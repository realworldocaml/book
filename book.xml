  <!-- Remember, using XIncludes means that you'll have to add a flag (typically 'xinclude' with one or two dashes) when using XML processors/parsers -->
  <!-- Validate with xmllint as follows (Basic setup same as libxslt: http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/InstallingAProcessor.html)-->
  <!-- (please collapse dashes in the line beloew) -->
