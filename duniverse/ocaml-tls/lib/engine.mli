(** Transport layer security

    [TLS] is an implementation of
    {{:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security}transport
    layer security} in OCaml.  TLS is a widely used security protocol
    which establishes an end-to-end secure channel (with optional
    (mutual) authentication) between two endpoints.  It uses TCP/IP as
    transport.  This library supports all three versions of TLS:
    {{:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246}1.2, RFC5246},
    {{:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4346}1.1, RFC4346}, and
    {{:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2246}1.0, RFC2246}.  SSL, the
    previous protocol definition, is not supported.

    TLS is algorithmically agile: protocol version, key exchange
    algorithm, symmetric cipher, and message authentication code are
    negotiated upon connection.

    This library implements several extensions of TLS,
    {{:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3268}AES ciphers},
    {{:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4366}TLS extensions} (such as
    server name indication, SNI),
    {{:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5746}Renegotiation extension},
    {{:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7627}Session Hash and Extended
    Master Secret Extension}.

    This library does not contain insecure cipher suites (such as
    single DES, export ciphers, ...).  It does not expose the server
    time in the server random, requires secure renegotiation.

    This library consists of a core, implemented in a purely
    functional matter ({!Engine}, this module), and effectful parts:
    {!Tls_lwt} and {!Tls_mirage}.
