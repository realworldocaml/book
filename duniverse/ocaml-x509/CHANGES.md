## v0.16.1 (2022-09-14)

* Support ECDSA signatures where the hash algorithm output length exceeds the
  size of the elliptic curve (by truncating, and using the leftmost bits).

## v0.15.1 (2021-10-26)

* avoid usae of deprecated functions of fmt (@hannesm)
* remove rresult dependency (@hannesm)

* FEATURE PKCS12 support (#114 by @hannesm)
* FEATURE ECDSA and EDDSA support via mirage-crypto-ec (#145 by @hannesm)
  This breaks some clients since the Private_key.t and Public_key.t variants
  are extended (may result in partial pattern matches of users of this library).
* CRL.is_revoked has `crls` as last parameter to avoid warning 16
  (4.12 compatibility) (#144 by @hannesm)
* Signing_request.sign: add optional labelled argument `~subject` to allow
  changing the subject when signing a signing request (#139 by @reynir)

  bad RSA keys were valid and should have been accepted by mirage-crypto.
  (#142 by @psafont)

## v0.11.2 (2020-05-14)

* Private_key.decode_{pem,der} now has a `~sloppy` option to recover from
  bad keys (where e.g. the private exponent d is wrong).
  (#135 by @hannesm, reported by @mattjbray in mirage/mirage-crypto#62)

* open variant for errors to make the composable (#133 by @dinosaure,
  review by @hannesm)
* BUGFIX avoid fractional seconds in generalized_time: truncate on serialising,
  validate them to be 0 on deserialising, as required in RFC 5280 4.1.2.5.2
  (#134 by @hannesm, reported by @ansiwen)

## v0.11.0 (2020-04-07)

* BREAKING Validation.validate_raw_signature results in a
  `(unit, signature_error) result` and logs (Logs.warn) if a weak (non-SHA2)
  hash algorithm was used. This function is used for verifying signatures
  on certificates, signing requests, and certificate revocation lists.
* The `` `CAInvalidSelfSignature `` constructor (Validation.ca_error) and
  `` `ChainInvalidSignature `` constructor (Validation.chain_validation_error)
  have been removed.
* BREAKING The polymorphic variant `Validation.chain_error` is now flat (the
  tags `` `Chain `` and `` `Leaf `` have been removed)
* BREAKING Adapted return type of CRL.validate and CRL.verify
* The pretty-printer Public_key.pp is now provided
* All implemented by @hannesm in #132 based on private conversation with @cfcs
  (who kindly reviewed the changes)

## v0.10.0 (2020-03-11)

* BREAKING #131 use mirage-crypto and mirage-crypto-pk instead of nocrypto
  raise lower OCaml bound to 4.07.0, test 4.10.0 in CI
* BREAKING #131 Certificate.Host_set is now Host.Set, and has pretty-printers
* BREAKING #131 Authenticator.null was removed (fixes #130, suggested by @emillon)
* BREAKING #131 Authenticator.t now requires (non-optional) ~host and ~time
  arguments which may return an option. This allows to more easily spot the
  cases where None is provided. Also, time is (unit -> Ptime.t option) instead
  of Ptime.t -- thus the timestamp at the time of certificate verification is
  used instead of the time of Authenticator construction. Similar changes in
  Validation for verify_chain, verify_chain_of_trust, trust_key_fingerprint,
  trust_cert_fingerprint.
  fixes #130, suggested by @emillon

## v0.9.0 (2020-01-22)

* BREAKING add a whitelist of hash algorithms used for signatures. The default
  whitelist is the SHA-2 family (without SHA-224), Validation.valid_ca{,s} use
  all algorithms as default
  reported by @emillon in #123, fixed in #128
* BREAKING Certificate.hostnames and Signing_request.hostnames (new) return a
  set of [`Wildcard|`Strict] * [`host] Domain_name.t (Certificate.Host_set.t)
  reported by @mmaker in #88, fixed in #127
* BREAKING #127 Signing_request.sign returns a result type now, an error is
  returned if the signing request was not properly signed
* BREAKING #127 Validation.{verify_chain_of_trust, trust_key_fingerprint,
  trust_cert_fingerptint} and the type Authenticator.t changed, no longer use
  of a Certificate.host, but instead a [`host] Domain_name.t (previously, it was
  a pair)
* BUGFIX support AlgorithmIdentifier of RSA signature algorithms with parameter
  not present
  reported by @Ulrar in #108, fixed in #129
* BUGFIX #127 preserve a signed signing request (Country in a DN sometimes uses
  a non-utf8 string encoding)
* remove deprecation from Validation.trust_cert_fingerprint and
  Authenticator.server_cert_fingerprint
  requested by @mben-romdhane in #125, fixed in #126
* Certificate.signature_algorithm, CRL.signature_algorithm, and
  Signing_request.signature_algorithm are now provided, returning a
  ([`RSA|`ECDSA] * Nocrypto.Hash.hash) option
  requested by @psafont in #123, fixed in #128

## v0.8.1 (2019-10-10)

* export Private_key.decode_der and encode_der

## v0.8.0 (2019-10-10)

* export X509.Distinguished_name.common_name : t -> string option, which
  extracts the common name of a distinguished name
* Distinguished_name.t is now a Relative_distinguished_name.t list, a
  Relative_distinguished_name is a Set.S with element type attribute, a variant.
  It used to be an attribute (expressed as GADT) Gmap.t, but this representation
  did not conform to RFC 5280, reported by @paurkedal (#117, fixed by #118)
* Now using Set.find_first_opt, which bumps lower OCaml bound to 4.05.0
* Improved pretty-printing for DNs including RFC 4514 conformance (@paurkedal, #119).
* Extension.pp now outputs extension key and its value (#120)
* rename Distinguished_name.SP constructor (stateOrProvince) to ST, as widely used (#121)
* support Street and UID in Distinguished_name to satisfy RFC 4514 demands (#121)

## v0.7.1 (2019-08-09)

* revert General_name.t (DNS and IP components) to string/Cstruct.t list
  - NameConstraints uses DNSname with strings with leading dots (.example.com),
    which are not valid RFC1034 domain names
  - NameConstraints uses IP with IP/netmask, i.e. using 8 octets for an IPv4
    address
  - X509.Certificate.hostnames still return a Domain_name.Set.t
  - reported by @reynir
* drop ipaddr dependency

## 0.7.0 (2019-07-24)

* major restructuring, it is unlikely any pre-0.7.0 users will work with 0.7.0+
* remove sexp de&encoders
* provide pretty-printers for validation errors (and types) instead of to_string functions
* use result type and Rresult instead of custom result types and control monad
* use a GADT map for certificate & csr extensions, distinguished names, general names (avoiding multiple extensions with the same OID, uses the gmap library)
* use domain-name library for hostname validation (instead of custom string matching)
* use ipaddr library for IPs in SubjectAlternativeName extension
* remove Encoding module, provide {en,de}code_{der,pem} in the respective modules (which decoders return (_, [> `Msg of string ]) result, no exceptions raised)
* fix DistributionPoint extension: the CRLissuer is a GeneralName, not a DistinguishedName
* remove Extension.reason_code (Extension.reason was there before, and is now used)
* remove bindings from toplevel, t is now Certificate.t, public_key is now Public_key.t
* use alcotest instead of oUnit

## 0.6.3 (2019-04-02)

* provide X509.Encoding.distinguished_name_of_cs -- similar to #87 which provided distinguished_name_to_cs
* provide X509.Encoding.{public_key_of_cstruct,public_key_to_cstruct}, as requested by @dinosaure
* support of cstruct 4.0.0, which split up the sexp de&encoders
* removes result dependency (now requires >= 4.04.2)
* upgrades opam file to version 2.0
* build system is now dune

## 0.6.2 (2018-08-24)

* expose `fingerprint : t -> hash -> Cstruct.t`, the hash of the certificate (@cfcs, #66)
* trust_fingerprint / server_fingerprint are renamed to trust_cert_fingerprint / server_cert_fingerprint (now deprecated!)
* fingerprint public keys (rather than certificates): trust_key_fingerprint / server_key_fingerprint
* build certificate paths from the received set (RFC 4158) instead of requiring a strict chain (#74)
* the given trust anchors to `Authenticator.chain_of_trust` are not validated (to contain KeyUsage / BasicConstraint extensions) anymore, users can use `valid_ca` and `valid_cas` to filter CAs upfront

## 0.4.0 (2015-07-02)

* certificate signing request support (PKCS10)
* basic CA functionality (in CA module): create and sign certificate signing requests

## 0.3.0 (2015-03-19)

* more detailed error messages (type certificate_failure modified)
* no longer Printf.printf debug messages
* error reporting: `Ok of certificate option | `Fail of certificate_failure
* fingerprint verification can work with None as host (useful for client authentication where host is not known upfront)
* API reshape: X509 is the only public module, X509.t is the abstract certificate

## 0.2.1 (2014-12-21)

* server_fingerprint authenticator which validates the server certificate based on a hash algorithm and (server_name * fingerprint) list instead of a set of trust anchors
* whitelist CAcert certificates (which do not include mandatory X.509v3 KeyUsage extension)

## 0.2.0 (2014-10-30)
