(** {1 Randomness} *)

(** Secure random number generation.

    There are several parts of this module:

    {ul
    {- The {{!Generator}signature} of generator modules, together with a
       facility to convert such modules into actual {{!g}generators}, and
       functions that operate on this representation.}
    {- A global generator instance, which needs to be initialized by calling
       {!set_default_generator}.}}
*)

(** {1 Usage notes} *)

(** {b TL;DR} Don't forget to seed; don't maintain your own [g].

    The RNGs here are merely the deterministic part of a full random number
    generation suite. For proper operation, they need to be seeded with a
    high-quality entropy source.

    Suitable entropy feeding of generators are provided by sub-libraries
    {{!Mirage_crypto_rng_lwt}mirage-crypto-rng.lwt} (for Lwt),
    {{!Mirage_crypto_rng_async}mirage-crypto-rng-async} (for Async),
    {{!Mirage_crypto_rng_mirage}mirage-crypto-rng-mirage} (for MirageOS),
    {{!Mirage_crypto_rng_unix}mirage-crypto-rng.unix},
    and {{!Mirage_crypto_rng_eio}mirage-crypto-rng-eio} (for Eio).

    The intention is that "initialize" in the respective sub-library is called
    once, which sets the default generator and registers entropy
    harvesting asynchronous tasks. The semantics is that the entropy is always
    fed to the {{!default_generator}default generator}, which is not necessarily
    the one set by "initialize". The reasoning behind this is that the default
    generator should be used in most setting, and that should be fed a constant
    stream of entropy.

    [mirage-crypto-rng-eio] package differs slightly from other rng packages.
    Instead of the [initilize] function a [run] function is provided with
    similar behaviour, i.e. RNG setup, entropy collection and periodic reseeding.

    Although this module exposes a more fine-grained interface, e.g. allowing
    manual seeding of generators, this is intended either for implementing
    entropy-harvesting modules, or very specialized purposes. Users of this
    library should almost certainly use one of the above entropy libraries, and
    avoid manually managing the generator seeding.

    Similarly, although it is possible to swap the default generator and gain
    control over the random stream, this is also intended for specialized
    applications such as testing or similar scenarios where the RNG needs to be
    fully deterministic (RFC 6979, deterministic usage of DSA), or as a
    component of deterministic algorithms which internally rely on pseudorandom
    streams.

    In the general case, users should not maintain their local instances of
    {{!g}g}. All of the generators in a process have to compete for entropy, and
    it is likely that the overall result will have lower effective
    unpredictability.

    The recommended way to use these functions is either to accept an optional
    generator and pass it down, or to ignore the generator altogether, as
    illustrated in the {{!rng_examples}examples}.

  val accumulate : g:g -> Entropy.source -> [`Acc of Cstruct.t -> unit]
  (** [accumulate ~g] is a closure suitable for incrementally feeding
      small amounts of environmentally sourced entropy into [g].

      Its operation should be fast enough for repeated calling from e.g.
      event loops. Systems with several distinct, stable entropy sources
