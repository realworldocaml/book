    complexities of multithreading, which is usually a bad idea.  It is much easier to use

    multithreading, and runs user code as ordinary async jobs.

      distinct element of the set.

      After a garbage collection determines that a heap block [b] is unreachable, it
      removes from the set of finalizers all finalizer pairs [(b, f)] whose block is [b],
      and then and runs [f b] for all such pairs.  Thus, a finalizer registered with
      [add_finalizer] will run at most once.

      The GC will call the finalisation functions in the order of deallocation.  When
      several values become unreachable at the same time (i.e. during the same GC cycle),
      the finalisation functions will be called in the reverse order of the corresponding
      calls to [add_finalizer].  If [add_finalizer] is called in the same order as the
      values are allocated, that means each value is finalised before the values it
      depends upon.  Of course, this becomes false if additional dependencies are
      introduced by assignments.

      In a finalizer pair [(b, f)], it is a mistake for the closure of [f] to reference
      (directly or indirectly) [b] -- [f] should only access [b] via its argument.
      Referring to [b] in any other way will cause [b] to be kept alive forever, since [f]
      itself is a root of garbage collection, and can itself only be collected after the
      pair [(b, f)] is removed from the set of finalizers.

      The [f] function can use all features of OCaml, including assignments that make the
      value reachable again.  It can also loop forever (in this case, the other
      finalisation functions will be called during the execution of f).  It can call
      [add_finalizer] on [v] or other values to register other functions or even itself.

      All finalizers are called with [Exn.handle_uncaught_and_exit], to prevent the
      finalizer from raising, because raising from a finalizer could raise to any
      allocation or GC point in any thread, which would be impossible to reason about.

      [add_finalizer_exn b f] is like [add_finalizer], but will raise if [b] is not a heap
      block.

      contained this value as key or data is unset before running the finalization

      The runtime uses this bool ref to ensure that only one finalizer is running at a
      time, by setting it to [true] when a finalizer starts and setting it to [false] when
      a finalizer finishes.  The runtime will not start running a finalizer if
      [!finalizer_is_running = true].  Calling [finalize_release] essentially does
      [finalizer_is_running := false], which allows another finalizer to start whether
      or not the current finalizer finishes. *)
