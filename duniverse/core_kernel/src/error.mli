   As with [Error.create], [sexp_of_a a] is lazily computed when the error is converted
   to a sexp. So if [a] is mutated in the time between the call to [failwiths] and the
   sexp conversion, those mutations will be reflected in the error message. Use
   [~strict:()] to force [sexp_of_a a] to be computed immediately.

   In this signature we write [~here:Lexing.position] rather than
   [~here:Source_code_position.t] to avoid a circular dependency. *)
