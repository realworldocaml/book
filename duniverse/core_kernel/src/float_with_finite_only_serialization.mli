(** An alias to the [Float.t] type that causes the sexp and bin-io serializers to fail
    when provided with [nan] or [infinity].

    Note that while it makes sense to use this on the definition of a type in the ml
    file, where it will influence the construction of the sexp and bin-io serializers, it
    does {e not} make sense to use this in an mli, since it makes no guarantee at that
    level.
