(** The internal time representation of [Zone.t]. This is a tiny subset of [Time0_intf.S],
    see that interface for details such as the meaning of [Span] and [Date_and_ofday].

    The name of the interface reflects the fact that the interface only gives you access
    to the seconds of the [t]. But you can use this interface with types that have higher
    precision than that, hence the rounding implied in the name of
    [to_int63_seconds_round_down_exn].

  (** The type of a time-zone.

      bin_io and sexp representations of Zone.t are the name of the zone, and
      not the full data that is read from disk when Zone.find is called.  The
      full Zone.t is reconstructed on the receiving/reading side by reloading
      the zone file from disk.  Any zone name that is accepted by [find] is
      acceptable in the bin_io and sexp representations. *)

  (** [likely_machine_zones] is a list of zone names that will be searched
      first when trying to determine the machine zone of a box.  Setting this

      use of the local timezone. *)

  (** A time zone index refers to a range of times delimited by DST transitions at one or
      both ends. Every time belongs to exactly one such range. The times of DST
      transitions themselves belong to the range for which they are the lower bound. *)

  (** [index_abbreviation_exn t index] returns the abbreviation name (such as EDT, EST,
      JST) of given zone [t] for the range of [index]. This string conversion is one-way
      only, and cannot reliably be turned back into a [t]. This function reads and writes
      the zone's cached index. Raises if [index] is out of bounds for [t]. *)
  val index_abbreviation_exn : t -> Index.t -> string

  (** Accessors for the DST transitions delimiting the start and end of a range, if any.
      The [_exn] accessors raise if there is no such transition. These accessors are split
      up to increase performance and improve allocation; they are intended as a low-level
      back-end for commonly-used time conversion functions. See [Time.Zone] and
      [Time_ns.Zone] for higher-level accessors that return an optional tuple for clock
      shifts in either direction. *)
