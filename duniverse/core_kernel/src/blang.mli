(** Boolean expressions. *)

(** A blang is a boolean expression built up by applying the usual boolean operations to
    properties that evaluate to true or false in some context.

    {2 Usage}

    For example, imagine writing a config file for an application that filters a stream of
    integers. Your goal is to keep only those integers that are multiples of either -3 or
    5. Using [Blang] for this task, the code might look like:

    {[
      module Property = struct
        type t =
          | Multiple_of of int
          | Positive
          | Negative
        [@@deriving sexp]

        let eval t num =
          match t with
          | Multiple_of n -> num % n = 0
          | Positive      -> num > 0
          | Negative      -> num < 0
      end

      type config = {
        keep : Property.t Blang.t;
      } [@@deriving sexp]

      let config = {
        keep =
          Blang.t_of_sexp
            Property.t_of_sexp
            (Sexp.of_string
               "(or (and negative (multiple_of 3)) (and positive (multiple_of 5)))";
      }

      let keep config num : bool =
        Blang.eval config.keep (fun p -> Property.eval p num)
    ]}

    Note how [positive] and [negative] and [multiple_of] become operators in a small,
    newly-defined boolean expression language that allows you to write statements like
    [(and negative (multiple_of 3))].

    {2 Blang sexp syntax}

    The blang sexp syntax is almost exactly the derived one, except that:

    1. Base properties are not marked explicitly.  Thus, if your base
    property type has elements FOO, BAR, etc., then you could write
    the following Blang s-expressions:

    {v
        FOO
        (and FOO BAR)
        (if FOO BAR BAZ)
    v}

    and so on.  Note that this gets in the way of using the blang
    "keywords" in your value language.

    2. [And] and [Or] take a variable number of arguments, so that one can
    (and probably should) write

    {v (and FOO BAR BAZ QUX) v}

    instead of

    {v (and FOO (and BAR (and BAZ QUX))) v}

    If you want to see the derived sexp, use [Raw.sexp_of_t].

(** Note that the sexps are not directly inferred from the type below -- there are lots of
    fancy shortcuts.  Also, the sexps for ['a] must not look anything like blang sexps.
    Otherwise [t_of_sexp] will fail.  The directly inferred sexps are available via
    [Raw.sexp_of_t]. *)

(** The following two functions are useful when one wants to pretend
    that ['a t] has constructors [And] and [Or] of type ['a t list -> 'a t].
    The pattern of use is

    {[
      match t with
      | And (_, _) as t -> let ts = gather_conjuncts t in ...
      | Or (_, _) as t -> let ts = gather_disjuncts t in ...
      | ...
    ]}

    or, in case you also want to handle [True] (resp. [False]) as a special
    case of conjunction (disjunction)

    {[
      match t with
      | True | And (_, _) as t -> let ts = gather_conjuncts t in ...
      | False | Or (_, _) as t -> let ts = gather_disjuncts t in ...
      | ...
    ]}
*)

(** [gather_conjuncts t] gathers up all toplevel conjuncts in [t].  For example,
    {ul {- [gather_conjuncts (and_ ts) = ts] }
    {- [gather_conjuncts (And (t1, t2)) = gather_conjuncts t1 @ gather_conjuncts t2] }
    {- [gather_conjuncts True = [] ] }
    {- [gather_conjuncts t = [t]] when [t] matches neither [And (_, _)] nor [True] } }
*)
val gather_conjuncts : 'a t -> 'a t list

(** [gather_disjuncts t] gathers up all toplevel disjuncts in [t].  For example,
    {ul {- [gather_disjuncts (or_ ts) = ts] }
    {- [gather_disjuncts (Or (t1, t2)) = gather_disjuncts t1 @ gather_disjuncts t2] }
    {- [gather_disjuncts False = [] ] }
    {- [gather_disjuncts t = [t]] when [t] matches neither [Or (_, _)] nor [False] } }

    (think of [v] as a variable and [f] as specifying the term to
    substitute for each variable) } }

(** [eval_set ~universe set_of_base expression] returns the subset of elements [e] in

    [eval_set] assumes, but does not verify, that [set_of_base] always returns a subset of
    [universe]. If this doesn't hold, then [eval_set]'s result may contain elements not
    in [universe].

    [And set1 set2] represents the elements that are both in [set1] and [set2], thus in
    the intersection of the two sets. Symmetrically, [Or set1 set2] represents the union
    of [set1] and [set2]. *)
