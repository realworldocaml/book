(** HTTP/1.1 request handling *)

(** This contains the metadata for a HTTP/1.1 request header, including
    the {!headers}, {!version}, {!meth} and {!uri}.  The body is handled by
    the separate {!S} module type, as it is dependent on the IO
    implementation.

    The interface exposes a [fieldslib] interface which provides individual
    accessor functions for each of the records below.  It also provides [sexp]
    serializers to convert to-and-from an {!Core.Std.Sexp.t}. *)
