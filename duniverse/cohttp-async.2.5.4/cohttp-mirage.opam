synopsis: "CoHTTP implementation for the MirageOS unikernel"
description: """
This HTTP implementation uses the Cohttp portable implementaiton
along with the Lwt threading library in order to provide a
`Cohttp_mirage` functor that can be used in MirageOS unikernels
to build very small and efficient HTTP clients and servers
without having a hard dependency on an underlying operating
system.

Please see <https://mirage.io> for a self-hosted explanation
and instructions on how to use this library."""
