Rresult — Result value combinators for OCaml
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%%VERSION%%

Rresult is an OCaml module for handling computation results and errors
in an explicit and declarative manner, without resorting to
exceptions. It defines combinators to operate on the `result` type
available from OCaml 4.03 in the standard library.

Rresult depends on the compatibility `result` package and is
distributed under the ISC license.
