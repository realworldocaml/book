Error (alert deprecated): Not_found
[since 2018-02] Instead of raising [Not_found], consider using [raise_s] with an
informative error message.  If code needs to distinguish [Not_found] from other
exceptions, please change it to handle both [Not_found] and [Not_found_s].  Then, instead
of raising [Not_found], raise [Not_found_s] with an informative error message.
