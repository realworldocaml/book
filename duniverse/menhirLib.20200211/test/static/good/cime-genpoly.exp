Built an LR(0) automaton with 50 states.
The grammar is not SLR(1) -- 8 states have a conflict.
The construction mode is pager.
Built an LR(1) automaton with 50 states.
32 shift/reduce conflicts were silently solved.
16 out of 50 states have a default reduction.
16 out of 50 states are represented.
0 out of 24 symbols keep track of their start position.
0 out of 24 symbols keep track of their end position.
15 out of 26 productions exploit shiftreduce optimization.
0 out of 50 states can peek at an error.
140 functions before inlining, 30 functions after inlining.
