Built an LR(0) automaton with 46 states.
The grammar is not SLR(1) -- 3 states have a conflict.
The construction mode is pager.

3 shift/reduce conflicts were silently solved.
11 out of 46 states have a default reduction.
14 out of 46 states are represented.
0 out of 28 symbols keep track of their start position.
0 out of 28 symbols keep track of their end position.
11 out of 20 productions exploit shiftreduce optimization.
0 out of 46 states can peek at an error.
