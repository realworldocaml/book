(** Local rewriting rules.

    This module lets you define local rewriting rules, such as extension point
    expanders. It is not completely generic and you cannot define any kind of
    rewriting, it currently focuses on what is commonly used. New scheme can be
    added on demand.

    We have some ideas to make this fully generic, but this hasn't been a
    priority so far. *)
module Rule : sig
  type t

  val extension : Extension.t -> t
  (** Rewrite an extension point *)

  val special_function : string -> (expression -> expression option) -> t
  (** [special_function id expand] is a rule to rewrite a function call at
      parsing time. [id] is the identifier to match on and [expand] is used to
      expand the full function application (it gets the Pexp_apply node). If the
      function is found in the tree without being applied, [expand] gets only
      the identifier (Pexp_ident node) so you should handle both cases.

      If [id] is an operator identifier and contains dots, it should be
      parenthesized (e.g. ["(+.+)"]).

      [expand] must decide whether the expression it receive can be rewritten or
      not. Especially ppxlib makes the assumption that [expand] is idempotent.
      It will loop if it is not. *)

      constants literals, based on the suffix character. *)

      of the item has the attribute. The expander is called as follow:

      [expand ~loc ~path rec_flag items values]

      where [values] is the list of values associated to the attribute for each
      item in [items]. [expand] must return a list of element to add after the
      group. For instance a list of structure item to add after a group of type
      definitions. *)
