(** [register_transformation name] registers a code transformation.

    [name] is a logical name for the transformation (such as [sexp_conv] or
    [bin_prot]). It is mostly used for debugging purposes.

    [rules] is a list of context independent rewriting rules, such as extension
    point expanders. This is what most code transformation should use. Rules
    from all registered transformations are all applied at the same time, before
    any other transformations. Moreover they are applied in a top-down manner,
    giving more control to extensions on how they interpret their payload.

    For instance:

    - some extensions capture a pretty-print of the payload in their expansion
      and using top-down ensures that the payload is as close as possible to the
      original code
    - some extensions process other extension in a special way inside their
      payload. For instance [%here] (from ppx_here) will normally expand to a
      record of type [Lexing.position]. However when used inside [%sexp] (from
      ppx_sexp_value) it will expand to the human-readable sexp representation
      of a source code position.

    [extensions] is a special cases of [rules] and is deprecated. It is only
    kept for backward compatibility.

    [enclose_impl] and [enclose_intf] produces a header and footer for
    implementation/interface files. They are a special case of [impl] and
    [intf]. The header is placed after any initial module-level attributes; the
    footer is placed after everything else. Both functions receive a location
    that denotes all of the items between header and footer, or [None] if the
    that list of items is empty.

    [impl] is an optional function that is applied on implementation files and
    [intf] is an optional function that is applied on interface files. These two
    functions are applied on the AST of the whole file. They should only be used
    when the other mechanism are not enough. For instance if the transformation
    expands extension points that depend on the context.

    If no rewriter is using [impl] and [intf], then the whole transformation is
    completely independent of the order in which the various rewriter are
    specified. Moreover the resulting driver will be faster as it will do only
    one pass (excluding safety checks) on the whole AST.

    [lint_impl] and [lint_intf] are applied to the unprocessed source. Errors
    they return will be reported to the user as preprocessor warnings.

    [instrument] can be used to instrument implementation files. Its
    transformation is applied to the AST of the whole file. The difference to
    [impl] is that you can specify if it should be applied before or after all
    rewriters defined through [rules], [impl] or [intf] are applied.

    Rewritings are applied in the following order:

    - linters ([lint_impl], [lint_intf])
    - preprocessing ([preprocess_impl], [preprocess_intf])
    - "before" instrumentations ([instrument], where instrument =
      [Instrument.make ~position:Before (...)])
    - context-independent rules ([rules], [extensions])
    - non-instrumentation whole-file transformations ([impl], [intf],
      [enclose_impl], [enclose_intf])
    - "after" instrumentations ([instrument], where instrument =
      [Instrument.make ~position:After (...)]) *)

(** Create a new file property.

    A file property represent a piece of information about a file that can be

    file.

    This mechanism is used to pass information gathered while preprocessing the
    file to the build system. For instance, this is used by ppx_inline_test to
    tell whether a file contains tests or not.
