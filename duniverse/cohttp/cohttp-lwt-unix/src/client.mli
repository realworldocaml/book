(** The [Client] module implements the full UNIX HTTP client interface,
    including the UNIX-specific functions defined in {!C }. *)

include Cohttp_lwt.S.Client with type ctx = Net.ctx

(** [custom_ctx ?ctx ?resolver ()] will return a context that is the
    same as the {!default_ctx}, but with either the connection handling
    or resolution module overridden with [ctx] or [resolver] respectively.

    This is useful to supply a {!Conduit_lwt_unix.ctx} with a custom
    source network interface, or a {!Resolver_lwt.t} with a different
    name resolution strategy (for instance to override a hostname to
    point it to a Unix domain socket). *)
val custom_ctx:
  ?ctx:Conduit_lwt_unix.ctx ->
  ?resolver:Resolver_lwt.t -> unit -> ctx
