(** This module extends the {{!Base.Linked_queue}[Base.Linked_queue]} module with bin_io
    support.  As a reminder, the [Base.Linked_queue] module is a wrapper around OCaml's
    standard [Queue] module that follows Base idioms and adds some functions.

    See also {!Core_kernel.Queue}, which has different performance characteristics. *)
