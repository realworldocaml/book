* Protocol_version_header - protocol-aware version negotiation

Protocol_version_header is a small library that houses magic numbers for various
protocols. It exposes a =negotiate= function that is magic number aware,
returning human readable error messages when negotiation fails.

This library is used directly by =Rpc= and =Krb= so the common mistake of
mismatching clients and servers can be detected.
