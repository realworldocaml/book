(**

   Outside of Core Time appears to be a single module with a number of submodules:

   - Time
   - Span
   - Ofday
   - Zone

   The reality under the covers isn't as simple for a three reasons:

   - We want as much Time functionality available to Core_kernel as possible, and
     Core_kernel modules shouldn't rely on Unix functions.  Some functions in Time
     require Unix, which creates one split.

   - We want some functionality to be functorized so that code can be shared
     between Time and Time_ns.

   - Time has internal circular dependencies.  For instance, Ofday.now relies on
     Time.now, but Time also wants to expose Time.to_date_ofday, which relies on Ofday.
     We use a stack of modules to break the cycle.

   This leads to the following modules within Core_kernel and Core:

   Core_kernel.Span  - the core type of span
   Core_kernel.Ofday - the core type of ofday, which is really a constrained span
   Core_kernel.Date  - the core type of date
   Core_kernel.Zone  - the base functor for creating a Zone type
   Core_kernel.Time_float0 - contains the base Time.t type and lays out the basic
   relationship between Time, Span, Ofday, and Zone
   Core_kernel.Time_float  - ties Time, Span, Ofday, Zone, and Date together and provides
   the higher level functions for them that don't rely on Unix
   Core_kernel.Time    - re-exposes Time_float

   Core.Zone_cache   - implements a caching layer between the Unix filesystem and Zones
   Core.Core_date    - adds the Unix dependent functions to Date
   Core.Core_time    - adds the Unix dependent functions to Time

   Core          - renames the Core_{base} modules to {base} for ease of access in
   modules outside of Core
