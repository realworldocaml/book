(** {6 Mapping files into memory} *)

(** Memory mapping of a file as a big array.
    [map_file fd kind layout ~shared dims] returns a big array of kind [kind],
    layout [layout], and dimensions as specified in [dims].

    The data contained in this big array are the contents of the file referred to by the
    file descriptor [fd].

    The optional [pos] parameter is the byte offset in the file of the data being mapped.
    It defaults to 0.

    If [shared] is [true], all modifications performed on the array are reflected in
    the file.  This requires that [fd] be opened with write permissions.  If [shared]
    is [false], modifications performed on the array are done in memory only, using
    copy-on-write of the modified pages; the underlying file is not affected.

    To adjust automatically the dimensions of the big array to the actual size of the
    file, the major dimension (that is, the first dimension for an array with C layout,
    and the last dimension for an array with Fortran layout) can be given as
    [-1]. [map_file] then determines the major dimension from the size of the file.
    The file must contain an integral number of sub-arrays as determined by the non-major
    dimensions, otherwise [Failure] is raised. If all dimensions of the big array are
    given, the file size is matched against the size of the big array.
    If the file is larger than the big array, only the initial portion of the file is
    mapped to the big array.  If the file is smaller than the bigarray, the file is
    automatically grown to the size of the big array. This requires write permissions on
    [fd].

    Array accesses are bounds-checked, but the bounds are determined by the initial call
    to [map_file]. Therefore, you should make sure no other process modifies the mapped
    file while you're accessing it, or a SIGBUS signal may be raised. This happens,
    for instance, if the file is shrunk. [Invalid_argument] or [Failure] may be raised
    in cases where argument validation fails.

(** Low-level process *)

(** [create_process ~prog ~args] forks a new process that executes the program [prog] with

    descriptors attached to stdin, stdout, and stderr of the new process.  The executable
    file [prog] is searched for in the path.  The new process has the same environment as
    the current process.  Unlike in [execve] the program name is automatically passed as
    the first argument. *)
val create_process : prog : string -> args : string list -> Process_info.t

(** [create_process_env ~prog ~args ~env] as [create_process], but takes an additional
    parameter that extends or replaces the current environment. No effort is made to
    ensure that the keys passed in as env are unique, so if an environment variable is set
    twice the second version will override the first. If [argv0] is given, it is used
    (instead of [prog]) as the first element of the [argv] array passed to [execve].

    The exact program to execute is determined using the usual conventions. More
    precisely, if [prog] contains at least one '/' character then it is used as is
    (relative to [working_dir] if [prog] is a relative path, absolute otherwise). Note
    that [working_dir] defaults to the working directory of the current process,
    i.e. [getcwd ()]. If [prog] contains no '/' character, then it is looked up in
    [prog_search_path]: for the first [dir] in [prog_search_path] such that
    [Filename.concat dir prog] exists and is executable, [Filename.concat dir prog] is the
    program that will be executed.

    [prog_search_path] defaults to the list of directories encoded as a ':' separated list
    in the "PATH" environment variable of the current running process. If no such variable
    is defined, then {[["/bin"; "/usr/bin"]]} is used instead. Note that the "PATH"
    environment variable is looked up in the environment of the current running process,
    i.e. via [getenv "PATH"]. Setting the "PATH" variable in the [env] argument of this
    function has no effect on how [prog] is resolved.

    In a setuid or setgid program, or one which has inherited such privileges, reading of
    the PATH variable will return an empty result.  If a search path is required then it
    should be provided explicitly using [prog_search_path] in such scenarios;
    alternatively, perhaps more satisfactorily, an absolute path should be given as
    [prog].
