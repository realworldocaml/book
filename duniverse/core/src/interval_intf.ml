      Suppose you had three intervals [a], [b], and [c]:

      {v

      definition of [create].

      If you think of an interval as a set of points, rather than a pair of its bounds,
      then [map] is not the same as the usual mathematical notion of mapping [f] over that
      set. For example, [map ~f:(fun x -> x * x)] maps the interval [[-1,1]] to [[1,1]],
      not to [[0,1]]. *)

      intervals [(i1, i2)], with [i1] drawn from [ilist1] and [i2] from [ilist2],
      returning just the non-empty intersections. By construction these intervals will be
      disjoint, too. For example:

      {[
        let i = Interval.create;;
        list_intersect [i 4 7; i 9 15] [i 2 4; i 5 10; i 14 20];;

  (** Returns true if the intervals, when considered as half-open intervals, nestle up
      cleanly one to the next. I.e., if you sort the intervals by the lower bound,
      then the upper bound of the [n]th interval is equal to the lower bound of the
      [n+1]th interval. The intervals do not need to partition the entire space, they just
      need to partition their union.
