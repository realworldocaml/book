    real-world programs, you'll need to leave the toplevel behind and start building programs from
    files. Files are more than just a convenient way to store and manage your code; in OCaml, they
    also correspond to modules, which act as boundaries that divide your program into conceptual
    units.</p><p>In this chapter, we'll show you how to build an OCaml program from a
  collection of files, as well as the basics of working with modules and
  module signatures.</p><section id="single-file-programs" data-type="sect1"><h1>Single-File Programs</h1><p>We'll start with an example: a utility that reads lines from <code>stdin</code> and computes a frequency count of the lines. At the end, the 10 lines with
      the highest frequency counts are written out. We'll start with a simple implementation, which
      we'll save as the file <em>freq.ml</em>.<a data-type="indexterm" id="FILEsnglprog" data-primary="files" data-secondary="single-file programs">&#xa0;</a><a data-type="indexterm" id="Psingfil" data-primary="programs" data-secondary="single-file programs">&#xa0;</a></p><p>This implementation will use two functions from the <code>List.Assoc</code> module, which provides utility
    functions for interacting with association lists, i.e., lists of key/value
    pairs. In particular, we use the function <code>List.Assoc.find</code>, which looks up a key in an
    association list; and <code>List.Assoc.add</code>,
    which adds a new binding to an association list, as shown here:<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="List.Assoc module" data-secondary="List.Assoc.add">&#xa0;</a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="List.Assoc module" data-secondary="List.Assoc.find">&#xa0;</a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="lists" data-secondary="adding new bindings in">&#xa0;</a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="lists" data-secondary="finding key associations in">&#xa0;</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/realworldocaml/examples/tree/v1/code/files-modules-and-programs/intro.topscript" class="orm:hideurl:ital"><em class="hyperlink">OCaml utop</em></a></p><pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="ocaml"><code class="prompt"># </code><strong><code>let assoc = [("one", 1); ("two",2); ("three",3)] ;;</code></strong>

    in lines from <code>stdin</code>, constructing from
    those lines an association list with the frequencies of each line. It does
    this by invoking <code>In_channel.fold_lines</code>
    (similar to the function <code>List.fold</code>
    described in <a href="#lists-and-patterns" data-type="xref">#lists-and-patterns</a>), which reads through
    the lines one by one, calling the provided <code>fold</code>
    function for each line to update the accumulator. That accumulator is
    initialized to the empty list.</p><p>With <code>build_counts</code> defined, we
    then call the function to build the association list, sort that list by
    frequency in descending order, grab the first 10 elements off the list,
    and then iterate over those 10 elements and print them to the screen.
    These operations are tied together using the <code>|&gt;</code> operator described in <a href="#variables-and-functions" data-type="xref">#variables-and-functions</a>.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="let ( ) declaration">&#xa0;</a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="main function">&#xa0;</a></p><div class="allow_break" data-type="note"><h1>Where Is the Main Function?</h1><p>Unlike C, programs in OCaml do not have a unique <code>main</code> function. When an OCaml program is
      evaluated, all the statements in the implementation files are evaluated
      in the order in which they were linked together. These implementation
      files can contain arbitrary expressions, not just function definitions.
      In this example, the declaration starting with <code>let () =</code> plays the role of the <code>main</code> function, kicking off the processing. But
      really the entire file is evaluated at startup, and so in some sense the
      full codebase is one big <code>main</code>
      function.</p><p>The idiom of writing <code>let () =</code>
      may seem a bit odd, but it has a purpose. The <code>let</code>
      binding here is a pattern-match to a value of type <code>unit</code>, which is there to ensure that the
      expression on the righthand side returns <code>unit</code>, as is common for functions that operate
      primarily by side effect.</p></div><p>If we weren't using Core or any other external libraries, we could

Programs
      compiled with <span class="command"><em>ocamlc</em></span> are interpreted
      by a virtual machine, while programs compiled with <span class="command"><em>ocamlopt</em></span> are compiled to native machine code
      to be run on a specific operating system and processor architecture.
      With <span class="command"><em>ocamlbuild</em></span>, targets ending with
      <code>.byte</code> are build as bytecode
      executables, and those ending with <code>.native</code> are built as native code.</p><p>Aside from performance, executables generated by the two compilers
      have nearly identical behavior. There are a few things to be aware of.
      First, the bytecode compiler can be used on more architectures, and has
      some tools that are not available for native code. For example, the
      OCaml debugger only works with bytecode (although <span class="command"><em>gdb</em></span>, the GNU Debugger, works with OCaml
      native-code applications). The bytecode compiler is also quicker than
      the native-code compiler. In addition, in order to run a bytecode
      executable, you typically need to have OCaml installed on the system in
      question. That's not strictly required, though, since you can build a
      bytecode executable with an embedded runtime, using the <code>-custom</code> compiler flag.</p><p>As a general matter, production executables should usually be
      built using the native-code compiler, but it sometimes makes sense to
      use bytecode for development builds. And, of course, bytecode makes
      sense when targeting a platform not supported by the native-code
      compiler. We'll cover both compilers in more detail in <a href="#the-compiler-backend-byte-code-and-native-code" data-type="xref">#the-compiler-backend-byte-code-and-native-code</a>.</p></div></section><section id="multi-file-programs-and-modules" data-type="sect1"><h1>Multifile Programs and Modules</h1><p>Source files in OCaml are tied into the module system, with each
    file compiling down into a module whose name is derived from the name of
    the file. We've encountered modules before, such as when we used functions
    like <code>find</code> and <code>add</code> from the <code>List.Assoc</code> module. At its simplest, you can
    think of a module as a collection of definitions that are stored within a
    namespace.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="modules" data-secondary="basics of">&#xa0;</a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="files" data-secondary="multi-file programs">&#xa0;</a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="programs" data-secondary="multi-file programs">&#xa0;</a></p><p>Let's consider how we can use modules to refactor the implementation
    of <code>freq.ml</code>. Remember that the variable
    <code>counts</code> contains an association list
    representing the counts of the lines seen so far. But updating an
    association list takes time linear in the length of the list, meaning that
    the time complexity of processing a file is quadratic in the number of
    distinct lines in the file.</p><p>We can fix this problem by replacing association lists with a more
    efficient data structure. To do that, we'll first factor out the key
    functionality into a separate module with an explicit interface. We can
    consider alternative (and more efficient) implementations once we have a
    clear interface to program against.</p><p>We'll start by creating a file, <code>counter.ml</code>, that contains the logic for
    maintaining the association list used to represent the frequency counts.
    The key function, called <code>touch</code>, bumps
    the frequency count of a given line by one:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/realworldocaml/examples/tree/v1/code/files-modules-and-programs-freq-with-counter/counter.ml" class="orm:hideurl:ital"><em class="hyperlink">OCaml</em></a></p><pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="ocaml">open Core.Std

    module named <code>Counter</code>, where the name of
    the module is derived automatically from the filename. The module name is
    capitalized even if the file is not. Indeed, module names are always
    capitalized.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="modules" data-secondary="naming of">&#xa0;</a></p><p>We can now rewrite <code>freq.ml</code> to use

    fact that the empty set of frequency counts is represented as an empty

    median, and the function would return the lines before and after the
    median instead. We'll use a custom type to represent the fact that there
    are two possible return values. Here's a possible implementation:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/realworldocaml/examples/tree/v1/code/files-modules-and-programs-freq-median/counter.ml" class="orm:hideurl:ital"><em class="hyperlink">OCaml</em></a>

    are created and accessed, and make it easier to enforce invariants beyond
    what is enforced by the type itself; concrete types let you expose more
    detail and structure to client code in a lightweight way. The right choice
    depends very much on the context.</p></section><section id="nested-modules" data-type="sect1"><h1>Nested Modules</h1><p>Up until now, we've only considered modules that correspond to
    files, like <code>counter.ml</code>. But modules
    (and module signatures) can be nested inside other modules. As a simple
    example, consider a program that needs to deal with multiple identifiers
    like usernames and hostnames. If you just represent these as strings, then
    it becomes easy to confuse one with the other.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="identifiers" data-secondary="dealing with multiple">&#xa0;</a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="nested modules">&#xa0;</a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="modules" data-secondary="nested modules">&#xa0;</a></p><p>A better approach is to mint new abstract types for each identifier,
    where those types are under the covers just implemented as strings. That
    way, the type system will prevent you from confusing a username with a
    hostname, and if you do need to convert, you can do so using explicit
    conversions to and from the string type.</p><p>Here's how you might create such an abstract type, within a

    using the module name as an explicit qualifier. For example, you write
    <code>List.map</code> to refer to the <code>map</code> function in the <code>List</code> module. Sometimes, though, you want to be
    able to refer to the contents of a module without this explicit
    qualification. That's what the <code>open</code>
    statement is for.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="identifiers" data-secondary="open modules and">&#xa0;</a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="modules" data-secondary="opening">&#xa0;</a></p><p>We've encountered <code>open</code> already,
    specifically where we've written <code>open
    Core.Std</code> to get access to the standard definitions in the Core
    library. In general, opening a module adds the contents of that module to
    the environment that the compiler looks at to find the definition of
    various identifiers. Here's an example:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/realworldocaml/examples/tree/v1/code/files-modules-and-programs/main.topscript" class="orm:hideurl:ital"><em class="hyperlink">OCaml utop</em></a></p><pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="ocaml"><code class="prompt"># </code><strong><code>module M = struct let foo = 3 end;;</code></strong>

<code class="prompt"># </code><strong><code>open M;;</code></strong>
<code class="prompt"># </code><strong><code>foo;;</code></strong>
<code class="computeroutput">- : int = 3</code></pre><p><code>open</code> is essential when you want
    to modify your environment for a standard library like Core, but it's
    generally good style to keep the opening of modules to a minimum. Opening
    a module is basically a trade-off between terseness and explicitness—the
    more modules you open, the fewer module qualifications you need, and the
    harder it is to look at an identifier and figure out where it comes
    from.</p><p>Here's some general advice on how to deal with
    <code>open</code>s:<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="local opens">&#xa0;</a></p><ul><li><p>Opening modules at the toplevel of a module should be done quite
        sparingly, and generally only with modules that have been specifically
        designed to be opened, like <code>Core.Std</code> or <code>Option.Monad_infix</code>.</p></li><li><p>If you do need to do an open, it's better to do a
        <em>local open</em>. There are two syntaxes for local
        opens. For example, you can write:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/realworldocaml/examples/tree/v1/code/files-modules-and-programs/main.topscript" class="orm:hideurl:ital"><em class="hyperlink">OCaml utop</em></a>

        operators are the ones from the <code>Int64</code> module.</p><p>There's another, even more lightweight syntax for local
        <code>open</code>s, which is particularly useful for small
        expressions:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/realworldocaml/examples/tree/v1/code/files-modules-and-programs/main.topscript" class="orm:hideurl:ital"><em class="hyperlink">OCaml utop</em></a>

        code terser without giving up on explicitness is to locally rebind the
        name of a module. So, when using the <code>Counter.median</code> type, instead of
        writing:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/realworldocaml/examples/tree/v1/code/files-modules-and-programs-freq-median/use_median_1.ml" class="orm:hideurl:ital"><em class="hyperlink">OCaml</em></a>

    printf "Before and after median:\n   %s\n   %s\n" before after</pre><p>Because the module name <code>C</code>
        only exists for a short scope, it's easy to read and remember what
        <code>C</code> stands for. Rebinding modules to

      collection of definitions that all refer to one another. If you want to
      create such definitions, you typically have to mark them specially. For
      example, when defining a set of mutually recursive values (like the
      definition of <code>is_even</code> and <code>is_odd</code> in <a href="#recursive-functions" data-type="xref">#recursive-functions</a>), you need to define them using
      <code>let rec</code> rather than ordinary <code>let</code>.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="dependencies, cyclic">&#xa0;</a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="cyclic dependencies">&#xa0;</a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="errors" data-secondary="cyclic dependencies">&#xa0;</a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="modules" data-secondary="cyclic dependencies">&#xa0;</a></p><p>The same is true at the module level. By default, cyclic
      dependencies between modules are not allowed, and cyclic dependencies
      among files are never allowed. Recursive modules are possible but are a
      rare case, and we won't discuss them further here.</p><p>The simplest example of a forbidden circular reference is a module
      referring to its own module name. So, if we tried to add a reference to
      <code>Counter</code> from within <code>counter.ml</code>:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/realworldocaml/examples/tree/v1/code/files-modules-and-programs-freq-cyclic1/counter.ml" class="orm:hideurl:ital"><em class="hyperlink">OCaml</em></a>

      close this chapter with some advice on how to think about designing that structure
      effectively.</p><section data-type="sect2"><h2>Expose Concrete Types Rarely</h2><p>When designing an <code>mli</code>, one choice that you need to make is whether to
        expose the concrete definition of your types or leave them abstract. Most of the time,
        abstraction is the right choice, for two reasons: it enhances the flexibility of your
        design, and it makes it possible to enforce invariants on the use of your module.</p><p>Abstraction enhances flexibility by restricting how users can interact with your types,
        thus reducing the ways in which users can depend on the details of your implementation. If
        you expose types explicitly, then users can depend on any and every detail of the types you
        choose. If they're abstract, then only the specific operations you want to expose are
        available. This means that you can freely change the implementation without affecting
        clients, as long as you preserve the semantics of those operations.</p><p>In a similar way, abstraction allows you to enforce invariants on your types. If your
        types are exposed, then users of the module can create new instances of that type (or if
        mutable, modify existing instances) in any way allowed by the underlying type. That may
        violate a desired invariant <em>i.e.</em>, a property about your type that is
        always supposed to be true. Abstract types allow you to protect invariants by making sure
        that you only expose functions that preserves your invariants. </p><p>Despite these benefits, there is a trade-off here. In particular, exposing types
        concretely makes it possible to use pattern-matching with those types, which as we saw in
        <span class="keep-together"><a href="#lists-and-patterns" data-type="xref">#lists-and-patterns</a> </span>is a powerful and important tool. You should generally only
        expose the concrete implementation of your types when there's significant value in the
        ability to pattern match, and when the invariants that you care about are already enforced
        by the data type itself.</p></section><section data-type="sect2"><h2>Design for the Call Site</h2><p>When writing an interface, you should think not just about how easy it is to understand
        the interface for someone who reads your carefully documented <code>mli</code> file,
        but more importantly, you want the call to be as obvious as possible for someone who is
        reading it at the call site.</p><p>The reason for this is that most of the time, people interacting with your API will be
        doing so by reading and modifying code that uses the API, not by reading the interface
        definition. By making your API as obvious as possible from that perspective, you simplify
        the lives of your users.</p><p>There are many ways of improving readability at the call site. One example is labeled
        arguments (discussed in <a href="#labeled-arguments" data-type="xref">#labeled-arguments</a>), which act as documentation
        that is available at the call site. </p><p>You can also improve readability simply by choosing good names for your functions,
        variant tags and record fields. Good names aren't always long, to be clear. If you wanted to
        write an anonymous function for doubling a number: <code>(fun x -&gt; x * 2)</code>, a
        short variable name like <code>x</code> is best. A good rule of thumb is that names
        that have a small scope should be short, whereas names that have a large scope, like the
        name of a function in an a module interface, should be longer and more explicit.</p><p>There is of course a tradeoff here, in that making your APIs more explicit tends to make
        them more verbose as well. Another useful rule of thumb is that more rarely used names
        should be longer and more explicit, since the cost of concision and the benefit of
        explicitness become more important the more often a name is used.</p></section><section data-type="sect2"><h2>Create Uniform Interfaces</h2><p>Designing the interface of a module is a task that should not be thought of in
        isolation. The interfaces that appear in your codebase should play together harmoniously.
        Part of achieving that is standardizing aspects of those interfaces.</p><p>Core itself is a library that works hard to create uniform interfaces. Here are some of
        the guidelines that are used in Core.</p><ul><li><p><em>A module for (almost) every type.</em> You should mint a module for
            almost every type in your program, and the primary type of a given module should be
            called <code>t</code>.</p></li><li><p><em>Put <code>t</code> first</em>. If you have a module <code>M</code>
            whose primary type is <code>M.t</code>, the functions in <code>M</code> that
            take a value of <code>M.t</code> should take it as their first argument.</p></li><li><p>Functions that routinely throw an exception should end in <code>_exn</code>. Otherwise,
            errors should be signaled by returning an <code>option</code> or an
          <code>Or_error.t</code> (both of which are discussed in <a href="#error-handling" data-type="xref">#error-handling</a> ).</p></li></ul><p>There are also standards in Core about what the type signature for specific functions
        should be. For example, the signature for <code>map</code> is always essentially the
        same, no matter what the underlying type it is applied to. This kind of function-by-function
        API uniformity is achieved through the use of <em>signature includes</em>, which
        allow for different modules to share components of their interface. This approach is
        described in <a href="#using-multiple-interfaces" data-type="xref">#using-multiple-interfaces</a>. </p><p>Core's standards may or may not fit your projects, but you can improve the usability of
        your codebase by finding some consistent set of standards to apply.</p></section><section data-type="sect2"><h2>Interfaces before implementations</h2><p>OCaml's concise and flexible type language enables a type-oriented
        approach to software design.  Such an approach involves thinking
        through and writing out the types you're going to use before embarking
        on the implementation itself.</p><p>This is a good approach both when working in the core language, where you would write
        your type definitions before writing the logic of your computations, as well as at the
        module level, where you would write a first draft of your <code>mli</code> before
        working on the <code>ml</code>.</p><p>Of course, the design process goes in both directions. You'll often find yourself going
        back and modifying your types in response to things you learn by working on the
        implementation. But types and signatures provide a lightweight tool for constructing a
        skeleton of your design in a way that helps clarify your goals and intent, before you spend
        a lot of time and effort fleshing it out.</p></section></section></section>
