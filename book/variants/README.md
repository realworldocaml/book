# Variants

Variant types are one of the most useful features of OCaml and also
one of the most unusual. They let you represent data that may take on
multiple different forms, where each form is marked by an explicit
tag. As we'll see, when combined with pattern matching, variants give
you a powerful way of representing complex data and of organizing the
case-analysis on that information.  [variant types/usefulness
of]{.idx} [datatypes/variant types]{.idx}

The basic syntax of a variant type declaration is as follows: [variant
types/basic syntax of]{.idx}

```
type <variant> =
  | <Tag> [ of <type> [* <type>]... ]
  | <Tag> [ of <type> [* <type>]... ]
  | ...
```

\noindent
Each row essentially represents a case of the variant. Each case has
an associated tag (also called a *constructor*, since you use it to
construct a value) and may optionally have a sequence of fields, where
each field has a specified type.

Let's consider a concrete example of how variants can be useful.  Most
UNIX-like operating systems support terminals as a fundamental,
text-based user interface.  Almost all of these terminals support a
set of eight basic colors.

Those colors can be naturally represented as a variant. Each color is
declared as a simple tag, with pipes used to separate the different
cases. Note that variant tags must be capitalized.

```ocaml env=main
open Base
open Stdio
type basic_color =
  | Black | Red | Green | Yellow | Blue | Magenta | Cyan | White
```

As we show below, the variant tags introduced by the definition of
`basic_color` can be used for constructing values of that type.

```ocaml env=main
# Cyan;;
- : basic_color = Cyan
# [Blue; Magenta; Red];;
- : basic_color list = [Blue; Magenta; Red]
```

The following function uses pattern matching to convert each of these
to the corresponding integer code that is used for communicating these
colors to the terminal.

```ocaml env=main
# let basic_color_to_int = function
    | Black -> 0 | Red     -> 1 | Green -> 2 | Yellow -> 3
    | Blue  -> 4 | Magenta -> 5 | Cyan  -> 6 | White  -> 7;;
val basic_color_to_int : basic_color -> int = <fun>
# List.map ~f:basic_color_to_int [Blue;Red];;
- : int list = [4; 1]
```

We know that the above function handles every color in `basic_color`
because the compiler would have warned us if we'd missed one:

```ocaml env=main
# let incomplete_color_to_int = function
    | Black -> 0 | Red -> 1 | White -> 7;;
Lines 1-2, characters 31-41:
Warning 8 [partial-match]: this pattern-matching is not exhaustive.
Here is an example of a case that is not matched:
(Green|Yellow|Blue|Magenta|Cyan)
val incomplete_color_to_int : basic_color -> int = <fun>
```

In any case, using the correct function, we can generate escape codes
to change the color of a given string displayed in a terminal.

```ocaml env=main
# let color_by_number number text =
  Printf.sprintf "\027[38;5;%dm%s\027[0m" number text;;
val color_by_number : int -> string -> string = <fun>
# let blue = color_by_number (basic_color_to_int Blue) "Blue";;
val blue : string = "\027[38;5;4mBlue\027[0m"
# printf "Hello %s World!\n" blue;;
Hello Blue World!
- : unit = ()
```

\noindent
On most terminals, that word "Blue" will be rendered in blue.

In this example, the cases of the variant are simple tags with no
associated data. This is substantively the same as the enumerations
found in languages like C and Java. But as we'll see, variants can do
considerably more than represent simple enumerations.

As it happens, an enumeration isn't enough to effectively describe the
full set of colors that a modern terminal can display. Many terminals,
including the venerable `xterm`, support 256 different colors, broken
up into the following groups:

- The eight basic colors, in regular and bold versions

- A $6 \times  6 \times  6$ RGB color cube

- A 24-level grayscale ramp

We'll also represent this more complicated color space as a variant,
but this time, the different tags will have arguments that describe
the data available in each case. Note that variants can have multiple
arguments, which are separated by `*`s.

```ocaml env=main
type weight = Regular | Bold
type color =
  | Basic of basic_color * weight (* basic colors, regular and bold *)
  | RGB   of int * int * int      (* 6x6x6 color cube *)
  | Gray  of int                  (* 24 grayscale levels *)
```

As before, we can use these introduced tags to construct values of our
newly defined type.

```ocaml env=main
# [RGB (250,70,70); Basic (Green, Regular)];;
- : color list = [RGB (250, 70, 70); Basic (Green, Regular)]
```

And again, we'll use pattern matching to convert a color to a
corresponding integer.  In this case, the pattern matching does more
than separate out the different cases; it also allows us to extract
the data associated with each tag:

```ocaml env=main
# let color_to_int = function
    | Basic (basic_color,weight) ->
      let base = match weight with Bold -> 8 | Regular -> 0 in
      base + basic_color_to_int basic_color
    | RGB (r,g,b) -> 16 + b + g * 6 + r * 36
    | Gray i -> 232 + i;;
val color_to_int : color -> int = <fun>
```

Now, we can print text using the full set of available colors:

```ocaml env=main
# let color_print color s =
  printf "%s\n" (color_by_number (color_to_int color) s);;
val color_print : color -> string -> unit = <fun>
# color_print (Basic (Red,Bold)) "A bold red!";;
A bold red!
- : unit = ()
# color_print (Gray 4) "A muted gray...";;
A muted gray...
- : unit = ()
```

#### Variants, Tuples and Parens

Variants with multiple arguments look an awful lot like tuples.
Consider the following example of a value of the type `color` we
defined earlier.

```ocaml env=main
# RGB (200,0,200);;
- : color = RGB (200, 0, 200)
```

It really looks like we've created a 3-tuple and wrapped it with the
`RGB` constructor. But that's not what's really going on, as you can
see if we create a tuple first and then place it inside the `RGB`
constructor.

```ocaml env=main
# let purple = (200,0,200);;
val purple : int * int * int = (200, 0, 200)
# RGB purple;;
Line 1, characters 1-11:
Error: The constructor RGB expects 3 argument(s),
       but is applied here to 1 argument(s)
```

\noindent
We can also create variants that explicitly contain tuples, like this
one.

```ocaml env=main
# type tupled = Tupled of (int * int);;
type tupled = Tupled of (int * int)
```

\noindent
The syntactic difference is unfortunately quite subtle, coming down to
the extra set of parens around the arguments. But having defined it
this way, we can now take the tuple in and out freely.

```ocaml env=main
# let of_tuple x = Tupled x;;
val of_tuple : int * int -> tupled = <fun>
# let to_tuple (Tupled x) = x;;
val to_tuple : tupled -> int * int = <fun>
```

If, on the other hand, we define a variant without the parens, then we
get the same behavior we got with the `RGB` constructor.

```ocaml env=main
# type untupled = Untupled of int * int;;
type untupled = Untupled of int * int
# let of_tuple x = Untupled x;;
Line 1, characters 18-28:
Error: The constructor Untupled expects 2 argument(s),
       but is applied here to 1 argument(s)
# let to_tuple (Untupled x) = x;;
Line 1, characters 14-26:
Error: The constructor Untupled expects 2 argument(s),
       but is applied here to 1 argument(s)
```

Note that, while we can't just grab the tuple as a whole from this
type, we can achieve more or less the same ends by explicitly
deconstructing and reconstructing the data we need.

```ocaml env=main
# let of_tuple (x,y) = Untupled (x,y);;
val of_tuple : int * int -> untupled = <fun>
# let to_tuple (Untupled (x,y)) = (x,y);;
val to_tuple : untupled -> int * int = <fun>
```

The differences between a multi-argument variant and a variant
containing a tuple are mostly about performance. A multi-argument
variant is a single allocated block in memory, while a variant
containing a tuple requires an extra heap-allocated block for the
tuple. You can learn more about OCaml's memory representation in
[Memory Representation of
Values](runtime-memory-layout.html#memory-representation-of-values){data-type=xref}.
:::


## Catch-All Cases and Refactoring

OCaml's type system can act as a refactoring tool, warning you of
places where your code needs to be updated to match an interface
change. This is particularly valuable in the context of
variants.
[pattern matching/catch-all cases]{.idx}
[refactoring]{.idx}
[exhaustion checks]{.idx}

Consider what would happen if we were to change the definition of
`color` to the following:

```ocaml env=main
type color =
  | Basic of basic_color     (* basic colors *)
  | Bold  of basic_color     (* bold basic colors *)
  | RGB   of int * int * int (* 6x6x6 color cube *)
  | Gray  of int             (* 24 grayscale levels *)
```

We've essentially broken out the `Basic` case into two cases, `Basic` and
`Bold`, and `Basic` has changed from having two arguments to one.
`color_to_int` as we wrote it still expects the old structure of the variant,
and if we try to compile that same code again, the compiler will notice the
discrepancy:

```ocaml env=main
# let color_to_int = function
    | Basic (basic_color,weight) ->
      let base = match weight with Bold -> 8 | Regular -> 0 in
      base + basic_color_to_int basic_color
    | RGB (r,g,b) -> 16 + b + g * 6 + r * 36
    | Gray i -> 232 + i;;
Line 2, characters 13-33:
Error: This pattern matches values of type 'a * 'b
       but a pattern was expected which matches values of type basic_color
```

Here, the compiler is complaining that the `Basic` tag is used with the wrong
number of arguments. If we fix that, however, the compiler will flag a second
problem, which is that we haven't handled the new `Bold` tag:

```ocaml env=main
# let color_to_int = function
    | Basic basic_color -> basic_color_to_int basic_color
    | RGB (r,g,b) -> 16 + b + g * 6 + r * 36
    | Gray i -> 232 + i;;
Lines 1-4, characters 20-24:
Warning 8 [partial-match]: this pattern-matching is not exhaustive.
Here is an example of a case that is not matched:
Bold _
val color_to_int : color -> int = <fun>
```

Fixing this now leads us to the correct implementation:

```ocaml env=main
# let color_to_int = function
    | Basic basic_color -> basic_color_to_int basic_color
    | Bold  basic_color -> 8 + basic_color_to_int basic_color
    | RGB (r,g,b) -> 16 + b + g * 6 + r * 36
    | Gray i -> 232 + i;;
val color_to_int : color -> int = <fun>
```

As we've seen, the type errors identified the things that needed to be
fixed to complete the refactoring of the code. This is fantastically
useful, but for it to work well and reliably, you need to write your
code in a way that maximizes the compiler's chances of helping you
find the bugs.  To this end, a useful rule of thumb is to avoid
catch-all cases in pattern matches.

Here's an example that illustrates how catch-all cases interact with
exhaustion checks. Imagine we wanted a version of `color_to_int` that
works on older terminals by rendering the first 16 colors (the eight
`basic_color`s in regular and bold) in the normal way, but renders
everything else as white.  We might have written the function as
follows.

```ocaml env=old_termcolor
# let oldschool_color_to_int = function
    | Basic (basic_color,weight) ->
      let base = match weight with Bold -> 8 | Regular -> 0 in
      base + basic_color_to_int basic_color
    | _ -> basic_color_to_int White;;
val oldschool_color_to_int : color -> int = <fun>
```

If we then applied the same fix we did above, we would have ended up with
this.

```ocaml env=main
# let oldschool_color_to_int = function
    | Basic basic_color -> basic_color_to_int basic_color
    | _ -> basic_color_to_int White;;
val oldschool_color_to_int : color -> int = <fun>
```

Because of the catch-all case, we'll no longer be warned about missing
the `Bold` case.  That's why you should beware of catch-all cases:
they suppress exhaustiveness checking.

## Combining Records and Variants

The term *algebraic data types* is often used to describe a collection
of types that includes variants, records, and tuples. Algebraic data
types act as a peculiarly useful and powerful language for describing
data. At the heart of their utility is the fact that they combine two
different kinds of types: *product types*, like tuples and records,
which combine multiple different types together and are mathematically
similar to Cartesian products; and *sum types*, like variants, which
let you combine multiple different possibilities into one type, and
are mathematically similar to disjoint unions.
[sum types]{.idx}
[product types]{.idx}
[algebraic data types]{.idx}
[variants and records]{.idx}

Algebraic data types gain much of their power from the ability to
construct layered combinations of sums and products. Let's see what we
can achieve with this by reiterating the `Log_entry` message type that
was described in [Records](records.html#records){data-type=xref}.

```ocaml env=main
module Time_ns = Core.Time_ns
module Log_entry = struct
  type t =
    { session_id: string;
      time: Time_ns.t;
      important: bool;
      message: string;
    }
end
```

This record type combines multiple pieces of data into a single value.
In particular, a single `Log_entry.t` has a `session_id` *and* a
`time` *and* an `important` flag *and* a `message`. More generally,
you can think of record types as conjunctions. Variants, on the other
hand, are disjunctions, letting you represent multiple possibilities.
To construct an example of where this is useful, we'll first write out
the other message types that came along-side `Log_entry`.

```ocaml env=main
module Heartbeat = struct
  type t =
    { session_id: string;
      time: Time_ns.t;
      status_message: string;
    }
end
module Logon = struct
  type t =
    { session_id: string;
      time: Time_ns.t;
      user: string;
      credentials: string;
    }
end
```

A variant comes in handy when we want to represent values that could
be any of these three types.  The `client_message` type below lets you
do just that.

```ocaml env=main
type client_message = | Logon of Logon.t
                      | Heartbeat of Heartbeat.t
                      | Log_entry of Log_entry.t
```

In particular, a `client_message` is a `Logon` *or* a `Heartbeat` *or*
a `Log_entry`. If we want to write code that processes messages
generically, rather than code specialized to a fixed message type, we
need something like `client_message` to act as one overarching type
for the different possible messages. We can then match on the
`client_message` to determine the type of the particular message being
handled.

You can increase the precision of your types by using variants to
represent differences between different cases, and records to
represent shared structure.  Consider the following function that
takes a list of `client_message`s and returns all messages generated
by a given user. The code in question is implemented by folding over
the list of messages, where the accumulator is a pair of:

- The list of messages so far that are associated with the user
- The set of session identifiers for the user that have been seen thus
  far

Here's the concrete code:

```ocaml env=main
# let messages_for_user user messages =
    let (user_messages,_) =
      List.fold messages ~init:([], Set.empty (module String))
        ~f:(fun ((messages,user_sessions) as acc) message ->
          match message with
          | Logon m ->
            if String.(m.user = user) then
              (message::messages, Set.add user_sessions m.session_id)
            else acc
          | Heartbeat _ | Log_entry _ ->
            let session_id = match message with
              | Logon     m -> m.session_id
              | Heartbeat m -> m.session_id
              | Log_entry m -> m.session_id
            in
            if Set.mem user_sessions session_id then
              (message::messages,user_sessions)
            else acc
        )
    in
    List.rev user_messages;;
val messages_for_user : string -> client_message list -> client_message list =
  <fun>
```

We take advantage of the fact that the type of the record `m` is known
in the above code, so we don't have to qualify the record fields by
the module they come from. *e.g.*, we write `m.user` instead of
`m.Logon.user`.

One annoyance of the above code is that the logic for determining the
session ID is somewhat repetitive, contemplating each of the possible
message types (including the `Logon` case, which isn't actually
possible at that point in the code) and extracting the session ID in
each case. This per-message-type handling seems unnecessary, since the
session ID works the same way for all message types.

We can improve the code by refactoring our types to explicitly reflect
the information that's shared between the different messages. The
first step is to cut down the definitions of each per-message record
to contain just the information unique to that record:

```ocaml env=main
module Log_entry = struct
  type t = { important: bool;
             message: string;
           }
end
module Heartbeat = struct
  type t = { status_message: string; }
end
module Logon = struct
  type t = { user: string;
             credentials: string;
           }
end
```

We can then define a variant type that combines these types:

```ocaml env=main
type details =
  | Logon of Logon.t
  | Heartbeat of Heartbeat.t
  | Log_entry of Log_entry.t
```

Separately, we need a record that contains the fields that are common across
all messages:

```ocaml env=main
module Common = struct
  type t = { session_id: string;
             time: Time_ns.t;
           }
end
```

A full message can then be represented as a pair of a `Common.t` and a
`details`. Using this, we can rewrite our preceding example as
follows. Note that we add extra type annotations so that OCaml
recognizes the record fields correctly. Otherwise, we'd need to
qualify them explicitly.

```ocaml env=main
# let messages_for_user user (messages : (Common.t * details) list) =
    let (user_messages,_) =
      List.fold messages ~init:([],Set.empty (module String))
        ~f:(fun ((messages,user_sessions) as acc) ((common,details) as message) ->
          match details with
          | Logon m ->
            if String.(=) m.user user then
              (message::messages, Set.add user_sessions common.session_id)
            else acc
          | Heartbeat _ | Log_entry _ ->
            if Set.mem user_sessions common.session_id then
              (message::messages, user_sessions)
            else acc
        )
    in
    List.rev user_messages;;
val messages_for_user :
  string -> (Common.t * details) list -> (Common.t * details) list = <fun>
```

As you can see, the code for extracting the session ID has been
replaced with the simple expression `common.session_id`.

In addition, this design allows us to grab the specific message and
dispatch code to handle just that message type. In particular, while
we use the type `Common.t * details` to represent an arbitrary
message, we can use `Common.t * Logon.t` to represent a logon
message. Thus, if we had functions for handling individual message
types, we could write a dispatch function as follows:

```ocaml env=main
# let handle_message server_state ((common:Common.t), details) =
    match details with
    | Log_entry m -> handle_log_entry server_state (common,m)
    | Logon     m -> handle_logon     server_state (common,m)
    | Heartbeat m -> handle_heartbeat server_state (common,m);;
val handle_message : server_state -> Common.t * details -> unit = <fun>
```

And it's explicit at the type level that `handle_log_entry` sees only
`Log_entry` messages, `handle_logon` sees only `Logon` messages, etc.

### Embedded Records

If we don't need to be able to pass the record types separately from
the variant, then OCaml allows us to embed the records directly into
the variant.

```ocaml env=main
type details =
  | Logon     of { user: string; credentials: string; }
  | Heartbeat of { status_message: string; }
  | Log_entry of { important: bool; message: string; }
```

Even though the type is different, we can write `messages_for_user` in
essentially the same way we did before.

```ocaml env=main
# let messages_for_user user (messages : (Common.t * details) list) =
    let (user_messages,_) =
      List.fold messages ~init:([],Set.empty (module String))
        ~f:(fun ((messages,user_sessions) as acc) ((common,details) as message) ->
          match details with
          | Logon m ->
            if String.(=) m.user user then
              (message::messages, Set.add user_sessions common.session_id)
            else acc
          | Heartbeat _ | Log_entry _ ->
            if Set.mem user_sessions common.session_id then
              (message::messages, user_sessions)
            else acc
        )
    in
    List.rev user_messages;;
val messages_for_user :
  string -> (Common.t * details) list -> (Common.t * details) list = <fun>
```

Variants with inline records are both more concise and more efficient
than having variants containing references to free-standing record
types, because they don't require a separate allocated object for the
contents of the variant.

The main downside is the obvious one, which is that an inline record
can't be treated as its own free-standing object. And, as you can see
below, OCaml will reject code that tries to do so.

```ocaml env=main
# let get_logon_contents = function
    | Logon m -> Some m
    | _ -> None;;
Line 2, characters 23-24:
Error: This form is not allowed as the type of the inlined record could escape.
```

## Variants and Recursive Data Structures

Another common application of variants is to represent tree-like recursive
data structures. We'll show how this can be done by walking through the
design of a simple Boolean expression language. Such a language can be useful
anywhere you need to specify filters, which are used in everything from
packet analyzers to mail clients.
[recursive data structures]{.idx}
[data structures/recursive]{.idx}
[variant types/and recursive data structures]{.idx}

An expression in this language will be defined by the variant `expr`, with
one tag for each kind of expression we want to support:

```ocaml env=main
type 'a expr =
  | Base  of 'a
  | Const of bool
  | And   of 'a expr list
  | Or    of 'a expr list
  | Not   of 'a expr
```

Note that the definition of the type `expr` is recursive, meaning that an
`expr` may contain other `expr`s. Also, `expr` is parameterized by a
polymorphic type `'a` which is used for specifying the type of the value that
goes under the `Base` tag.

The purpose of each tag is pretty straightforward. `And`, `Or`, and `Not` are
the basic operators for building up Boolean expressions, and `Const` lets you
enter the constants `true` and `false`.

The `Base` tag is what allows you to tie the `expr` to your application, by
letting you specify an element of some base predicate type, whose truth or
falsehood is determined by your application. If you were writing a filter
language for an email processor, your base predicates might specify the tests
you would run against an email, as in the following example:

```ocaml env=main
type mail_field = To | From | CC | Date | Subject
type mail_predicate = { field: mail_field;
                        contains: string }
```

\noindent
Using the preceding code, we can construct a simple expression with
`mail_predicate` as its base predicate:

```ocaml env=main
# let test field contains = Base { field; contains };;
val test : mail_field -> string -> mail_predicate expr = <fun>
# And [ Or [ test To "doligez"; test CC "doligez" ];
        test Subject "runtime";
      ];;
- : mail_predicate expr =
And
 [Or
   [Base {field = To; contains = "doligez"};
    Base {field = CC; contains = "doligez"}];
  Base {field = Subject; contains = "runtime"}]
```

Being able to construct such expressions isn't enough; we also need to be
able to evaluate them. Here's a function for doing just that:

```ocaml env=main
# let rec eval expr base_eval =
    (* a shortcut, so we don't need to repeatedly pass [base_eval]
       explicitly to [eval] *)
    let eval' expr = eval expr base_eval in
    match expr with
    | Base  base  -> base_eval base
    | Const bool  -> bool
    | And   exprs -> List.for_all exprs ~f:eval'
    | Or    exprs -> List.exists  exprs ~f:eval'
    | Not   expr  -> not (eval' expr);;
val eval : 'a expr -> ('a -> bool) -> bool = <fun>
```

The structure of the code is pretty straightforward—we're just pattern
matching over the structure of the data, doing the appropriate
calculation based on which tag we see. To use this evaluator on a
concrete example, we just need to write the `base_eval` function,
which is capable of evaluating a base predicate.

Another useful operation on expressions is *simplification*, which is
the process of taking a boolean expression and reducing it to an
equivalent one that is smaller.  First, we'll build a few simplifying
construction functions that mirror the tags of an `expr`.

The `and_` function below does a few things:

- Reduces the entire expression to the constant `false` if any of the
  arms of the `And` are themselves `false`.
- Drops any arms of the `And` that there the constant `true`.
- Drops the `And` if it only has one arm.
- If the `And` has no arms, then reduces it to `Const true`.

The code is below.

```ocaml env=main
# let and_ l =
    if List.exists l ~f:(function Const false -> true | _ -> false)
    then Const false
    else
      match List.filter l ~f:(function Const true -> false | _ -> true) with
      | [] -> Const true
      | [ x ] -> x
      | l -> And l;;
val and_ : 'a expr list -> 'a expr = <fun>
```

`Or` is the dual of `And`, and as you can see, the code for `or_`
follows a similar pattern as that for `and_`, mostly reversing the
role of `true` and `false`.

```ocaml env=main
# let or_ l =
    if List.exists l ~f:(function Const true -> true | _ -> false) then Const true
    else
      match List.filter l ~f:(function Const false -> false | _ -> true) with
      | [] -> Const false
      | [x] -> x
      | l -> Or l;;
val or_ : 'a expr list -> 'a expr = <fun>
```

Finally, `not_` just has special handling for constants, applying the
ordinary boolean negation function to them.

```ocaml env=main
# let not_ = function
    | Const b -> Const (not b)
    | e -> Not e;;
val not_ : 'a expr -> 'a expr = <fun>
```

We can now write a simplification routine that is based on the
preceding functions.  Note that this function is recursive, in that it
applies all of these simplifications in a bottom-up way across the
entire expression.

```ocaml env=main
# let rec simplify = function
    | Base _ | Const _ as x -> x
    | And l -> and_ (List.map ~f:simplify l)
    | Or l  -> or_  (List.map ~f:simplify l)
    | Not e -> not_ (simplify e);;
val simplify : 'a expr -> 'a expr = <fun>
```

We can now apply this to a Boolean expression and see how good a job
it does at simplifying it.

```ocaml env=main
# simplify (Not (And [ Or [Base "it's snowing"; Const true];
  Base "it's raining"]));;
- : string expr = Not (Base "it's raining")
```

\noindent
Here, it correctly converted the `Or` branch to `Const true` and then
eliminated the `And` entirely, since the `And` then had only one
nontrivial component.

There are some simplifications it misses, however. In particular, see
what happens if we add a double negation in.

```ocaml env=main
# simplify (Not (And [ Or [Base "it's snowing"; Const true];
  Not (Not (Base "it's raining"))]));;
- : string expr = Not (Not (Not (Base "it's raining")))
```

It fails to remove the double negation, and it's easy to see why. The
`not_` function has a catch-all case, so it ignores everything but the
one case it explicitly considers, that of the negation of a
constant. Catch-all cases are generally a bad idea, and if we make the
code more explicit, we see that the missing of the double negation is
more obvious:

```ocaml env=main
# let not_ = function
    | Const b -> Const (not b)
    | (Base _ | And _ | Or _ | Not _) as e -> Not e;;
val not_ : 'a expr -> 'a expr = <fun>
```

We can of course fix this by simply adding an explicit case for double
negation:

```ocaml env=main
# let not_ = function
    | Const b -> Const (not b)
    | Not e -> e
    | (Base _ | And _ | Or _ ) as e -> Not e;;
val not_ : 'a expr -> 'a expr = <fun>
```

The example of a Boolean expression language is more than a
toy. There's a module very much in this spirit in `Core` called
`Blang` (short for "Boolean language"), and it gets a lot of practical
use in a variety of applications.  The simplification algorithm in
particular is useful when you want to use it to specialize the
evaluation of expressions for which the evaluation of some of the base
predicates is already known.

More generally, using variants to build recursive data structures is a
common technique, and shows up everywhere from designing little
languages to building complex data structures.

## Polymorphic Variants

In addition to the ordinary variants we've seen so far, OCaml also
supports so-called *polymorphic variants*. As we'll see, polymorphic
variants are more flexible and syntactically more lightweight than
ordinary variants, but that extra power comes at a cost.
[polymorphic variant types/basic syntax of]{.idx}
[variant types/polymorphic]{.idx}

Syntactically, polymorphic variants are distinguished from ordinary
variants by the leading backtick. And unlike ordinary variants,
polymorphic variants can be used without an explicit type declaration:

```ocaml env=main
# let three = `Int 3;;
val three : [> `Int of int ] = `Int 3
# let four = `Float 4.;;
val four : [> `Float of float ] = `Float 4.
# let nan = `Not_a_number;;
val nan : [> `Not_a_number ] = `Not_a_number
# [three; four; nan];;
- : [> `Float of float | `Int of int | `Not_a_number ] list =
[`Int 3; `Float 4.; `Not_a_number]
```

As you can see, polymorphic variant types are inferred automatically,
and when we combine variants with different tags, the compiler infers
a new type that knows about all of those tags. Note that in the
preceding example, the tag name (e.g., `` `Int``) matches the type
name (`int`). This is a common convention in OCaml.
[polymorphic variant types/automatic inference of]{.idx}

The type system will complain if it sees incompatible uses of the same
tag:

```ocaml env=main
# let five = `Int "five";;
val five : [> `Int of string ] = `Int "five"
# [three; four; five];;
Line 1, characters 15-19:
Error: This expression has type [> `Int of string ]
       but an expression was expected of type
         [> `Float of float | `Int of int ]
       Types for tag `Int are incompatible
```

The `>` at the beginning of the variant types above is critical
because it marks the types as being open to combination with other
variant types.  We can read the type `` [> `Float of float | `Int of
int]`` as describing a variant whose tags include `` `Float of float``
and `` `Int of int``, but may include more tags as well. In other
words, you can roughly translate `>` to mean: "these tags or more."

OCaml will in some cases infer a variant type with `<`, to indicate
"these tags or less," as in the following example:

```ocaml env=main
# let is_positive = function
    | `Int   x -> x > 0
    | `Float x -> Float.(x > 0.);;
val is_positive : [< `Float of float | `Int of int ] -> bool = <fun>
```

\noindent
The `<` is there because `is_positive` has no way of dealing with
values that have tags other than `` `Float of float`` or `` `Int of
int``, but can handle types that have either or both of those two
tags.

We can think of these `<` and `>` markers as indications of upper and
lower bounds on the tags involved. If the same set of tags are both an
upper and a lower bound, we end up with an *exact* polymorphic variant
type, which has neither marker. For example:

```ocaml env=main
# let exact = List.filter ~f:is_positive [three;four];;
val exact : [ `Float of float | `Int of int ] list = [`Int 3; `Float 4.]
```

Perhaps surprisingly, we can also create polymorphic variant types that have
distinct upper and lower bounds. Note that `Ok` and `Error` in the following
example come from the `Result.t` type from `Base`.
[polymorphic variant types/upper and lower bounds of]{.idx}

```ocaml env=main
# let is_positive = function
    | `Int   x -> Ok (x > 0)
    | `Float x -> Ok Float.O.(x > 0.)
    | `Not_a_number -> Error "not a number";;
val is_positive :
  [< `Float of float | `Int of int | `Not_a_number ] -> (bool, string) result =
  <fun>
# List.filter [three; four] ~f:(fun x ->
  match is_positive x with Error _ -> false | Ok b -> b);;
- : [< `Float of float | `Int of int | `Not_a_number > `Float `Int ] list =
[`Int 3; `Float 4.]
```

Here, the inferred type states that the tags can be no more than ``
`Float``, `` `Int``, and `` `Not_a_number``, and must contain at least
`` `Float`` and `` `Int``. As you can already start to see,
polymorphic variants can lead to fairly complex inferred types.

::: {.allow_break data-type=note}
#### Polymorphic Variants and Catch-All Cases

As we saw with the definition of `is_positive`, a `match` expression
can lead to the inference of an upper bound on a variant type,
limiting the possible tags to those that can be handled by the match.
If we add a catch-all case to our `match` expression, we end up with a
type with a lower bound.  [pattern matching/catch-all cases]{.idx}
[catch-all cases]{.idx} [polymorphic variant types/and catch-all
cases]{.idx}

```ocaml env=main
# let is_positive_permissive = function
    | `Int   x -> Ok Int.(x > 0)
    | `Float x -> Ok Float.(x > 0.)
    | _ -> Error "Unknown number type";;
val is_positive_permissive :
  [> `Float of float | `Int of int ] -> (bool, string) result = <fun>
# is_positive_permissive (`Int 0);;
- : (bool, string) result = Ok false
# is_positive_permissive (`Ratio (3,4));;
- : (bool, string) result = Error "Unknown number type"
```

Catch-all cases are error-prone even with ordinary variants, but they
are especially so with polymorphic variants. That's because you have
no way of bounding what tags your function might have to deal with.
Such code is particularly vulnerable to typos.  For instance, if code
that uses `is_positive_permissive` passes in `Float` misspelled as
`Floot`, the erroneous code will compile without complaint.

```ocaml env=main
# is_positive_permissive (`Floot 3.5);;
- : (bool, string) result = Error "Unknown number type"
```

With ordinary variants, such a typo would have been caught as an
unknown tag.  As a general matter, one should be wary about mixing
catch-all cases and polymorphic variants.
:::

### Example: Terminal Colors Redux

To see how to use polymorphic variants in practice, we'll return to
terminal colors. Imagine that we have a new terminal type that adds
yet more colors, say, by adding an alpha channel so you can specify
translucent colors. We could model this extended set of colors as
follows, using an ordinary variant:
[polymorphic variant types/vs. ordinary variants]{.idx}

```ocaml env=main
type extended_color =
  | Basic of basic_color * weight  (* basic colors, regular and bold *)
  | RGB   of int * int * int       (* 6x6x6 color space *)
  | Gray  of int                   (* 24 grayscale levels *)
  | RGBA  of int * int * int * int (* 6x6x6x6 color space *)
```

We want to write a function `extended_color_to_int` that works like
`color_to_int` for all of the old kinds of colors, with new logic only for
handling colors that include an alpha channel. One might try to write such a
function as follows.

```ocaml env=main
# let extended_color_to_int = function
    | RGBA (r,g,b,a) -> 256 + a + b * 6 + g * 36 + r * 216
    | (Basic _ | RGB _ | Gray _) as color -> color_to_int color;;
Line 3, characters 59-64:
Error: This expression has type extended_color
       but an expression was expected of type color
```

The code looks reasonable enough, but it leads to a type error because
`extended_color` and `color` are in the compiler's view distinct and
unrelated types. The compiler doesn't, for example, recognize any
equality between the `Basic` tag in the two types.

What we want to do is to share tags between two different variant
types, and polymorphic variants let us do this in a natural way.
First, let's rewrite `basic_color_to_int` and `color_to_int` using
polymorphic variants.  The translation here is pretty straightforward:

```ocaml env=main
# let basic_color_to_int = function
    | `Black -> 0 | `Red     -> 1 | `Green -> 2 | `Yellow -> 3
    | `Blue  -> 4 | `Magenta -> 5 | `Cyan  -> 6 | `White  -> 7;;
val basic_color_to_int :
  [< `Black | `Blue | `Cyan | `Green | `Magenta | `Red | `White | `Yellow ] ->
  int = <fun>
# let color_to_int = function
    | `Basic (basic_color,weight) ->
      let base = match weight with `Bold -> 8 | `Regular -> 0 in
      base + basic_color_to_int basic_color
    | `RGB (r,g,b) -> 16 + b + g * 6 + r * 36
    | `Gray i -> 232 + i;;
val color_to_int :
  [< `Basic of
       [< `Black
        | `Blue
        | `Cyan
        | `Green
        | `Magenta
        | `Red
        | `White
        | `Yellow ] *
       [< `Bold | `Regular ]
   | `Gray of int
   | `RGB of int * int * int ] ->
  int = <fun>
```

Now we can try writing `extended_color_to_int`. The key issue with this code
is that `extended_color_to_int` needs to invoke `color_to_int` with a
narrower type, i.e., one that includes fewer tags. Written properly, this
narrowing can be done via a pattern match. In particular, in the following
code, the type of the variable `color` includes only the tags `` `Basic``,
`` `RGB``, and `` `Gray``, and not `` `RGBA``:

```ocaml env=main
# let extended_color_to_int = function
    | `RGBA (r,g,b,a) -> 256 + a + b * 6 + g * 36 + r * 216
    | (`Basic _ | `RGB _ | `Gray _) as color -> color_to_int color;;
val extended_color_to_int :
  [< `Basic of
       [< `Black
        | `Blue
        | `Cyan
        | `Green
        | `Magenta
        | `Red
        | `White
        | `Yellow ] *
       [< `Bold | `Regular ]
   | `Gray of int
   | `RGB of int * int * int
   | `RGBA of int * int * int * int ] ->
  int = <fun>
```

The preceding code is more delicately balanced than one might imagine. In
particular, if we use a catch-all case instead of an explicit enumeration of
the cases, the type is no longer narrowed, and so compilation fails:

```ocaml env=main
# let extended_color_to_int = function
    | `RGBA (r,g,b,a) -> 256 + a + b * 6 + g * 36 + r * 216
    | color -> color_to_int color;;
Line 3, characters 29-34:
Error: This expression has type [> `RGBA of int * int * int * int ]
       but an expression was expected of type
         [< `Basic of
              [< `Black
               | `Blue
               | `Cyan
               | `Green
               | `Magenta
               | `Red
               | `White
               | `Yellow ] *
              [< `Bold | `Regular ]
          | `Gray of int
          | `RGB of int * int * int ]
       The second variant type does not allow tag(s) `RGBA
```

Let's consider how we might turn our code into a proper library with
an implementation in an `ml` file and an interface in a separate
`mli`, as we saw in [Files Modules And
Programs](files-modules-and-programs.html#files-modules-and-programs){data-type=xref}.
Let's start with the `mli`.

```ocaml file=examples/correct/variants-termcol/terminal_color.mli
open Base

type basic_color =
  [ `Black   | `Blue | `Cyan  | `Green
  | `Magenta | `Red  | `White | `Yellow ]

type color =
  [ `Basic of basic_color * [ `Bold | `Regular ]
  | `Gray of int
  | `RGB  of int * int * int ]

type extended_color =
  [ color
  | `RGBA of int * int * int * int ]

val color_to_int          : color -> int
val extended_color_to_int : extended_color -> int
```

Here, `extended_color` is defined as an explicit extension of `color`. Also,
notice that we defined all of these types as exact variants. We can implement
this library as follows.

```ocaml file=examples/correct/variants-termcol/terminal_color.ml
open Base

type basic_color =
  [ `Black   | `Blue | `Cyan  | `Green
  | `Magenta | `Red  | `White | `Yellow ]

type color =
  [ `Basic of basic_color * [ `Bold | `Regular ]
  | `Gray of int
  | `RGB  of int * int * int ]

type extended_color =
  [ color
  | `RGBA of int * int * int * int ]

let basic_color_to_int = function
  | `Black -> 0 | `Red     -> 1 | `Green -> 2 | `Yellow -> 3
  | `Blue  -> 4 | `Magenta -> 5 | `Cyan  -> 6 | `White  -> 7

let color_to_int = function
  | `Basic (basic_color,weight) ->
    let base = match weight with `Bold -> 8 | `Regular -> 0 in
    base + basic_color_to_int basic_color
  | `RGB (r,g,b) -> 16 + b + g * 6 + r * 36
  | `Gray i -> 232 + i

let extended_color_to_int = function
  | `RGBA (r,g,b,a) -> 256 + a + b * 6 + g * 36 + r * 216
  | `Grey x -> 2000 + x
  | (`Basic _ | `RGB _ | `Gray _) as color -> color_to_int color
```

In the preceding code, we did something funny to the definition of
`extended_color_to_int` that highlights some of the downsides of
polymorphic variants.  In particular, we added some special-case
handling for the color gray, rather than using `color_to_int`.
Unfortunately, we misspelled `Gray` as `Grey`.  This is exactly the
kind of error that the compiler would catch with ordinary variants,
but with polymorphic variants, this compiles without issue.  All that
happened was that the compiler inferred a wider type for
`extended_color_to_int`, which happens to be compatible with the
narrower type that was listed in the `mli`.  As a result, this library
builds without error.

```sh dir=examples/correct/variants-termcol
$ dune build @all
```

If we add an explicit type annotation to the code itself (rather than
just in the `mli`), then the compiler has enough information to warn
us:

```ocaml file=examples/erroneous/variants-termcol-annotated/terminal_color.ml,part=1
let extended_color_to_int : extended_color -> int = function
  | `RGBA (r,g,b,a) -> 256 + a + b * 6 + g * 36 + r * 216
  | `Grey x -> 2000 + x
  | (`Basic _ | `RGB _ | `Gray _) as color -> color_to_int color
```

\noindent
In particular, the compiler will complain that the `` `Grey`` case is unused:

```sh dir=examples/erroneous/variants-termcol-annotated
$ dune build @all
File "terminal_color.ml", line 30, characters 4-11:
30 |   | `Grey x -> 2000 + x
         ^^^^^^^
Error: This pattern matches values of type [? `Grey of 'a ]
       but a pattern was expected which matches values of type extended_color
       The second variant type does not allow tag(s) `Grey
[1]
```

Once we have type definitions at our disposal, we can revisit the
question of how we write the pattern match that narrows the type. In
particular, we can explicitly use the type name as part of the pattern
match, by prefixing it with a `#`:

```ocaml file=examples/correct/variants-termcol-fixed/terminal_color.ml,part=1
let extended_color_to_int : extended_color -> int = function
  | `RGBA (r,g,b,a) -> 256 + a + b * 6 + g * 36 + r * 216
  | #color as color -> color_to_int color
```

This is useful when you want to narrow down to a type whose definition
is long, and you don't want the verbosity of writing the tags down
explicitly in the match.

### When to Use Polymorphic Variants

At first glance, polymorphic variants look like a strict improvement
over ordinary variants. You can do everything that ordinary variants
can do, plus it's more flexible and more concise. What's not to
like?
[polymorphic variant types/vs. ordinary variants]{.idx}
[polymorphic variant types/drawbacks of]{.idx}

In reality, regular variants are the more pragmatic choice most of the
time.  That's because the flexibility of polymorphic variants comes at
a price. Here are some of the downsides:

Complexity
: The typing rules for polymorphic variants are a lot more complicated
  than they are for regular variants. This means that heavy use of
  polymorphic variants can leave you scratching your head trying to
  figure out why a given piece of code did or didn't compile. It can
  also lead to absurdly long and hard to decode error
  messages. Indeed, concision at the value level is often balanced out
  by more verbosity at the type level.

Error-finding
: Polymorphic variants are type-safe, but the typing discipline that
  they impose is, by dint of its flexibility, less likely to catch
  bugs in your program.

Efficiency
: This isn't a huge effect, but polymorphic variants are somewhat
  heavier than regular variants, and OCaml can't generate code for
  matching on polymorphic variants that is quite as efficient as what
  it generated for regular variants.

All that said, polymorphic variants are still a useful and powerful
feature, but it's worth understanding their limitations and how to use
them sensibly and modestly.

Probably the safest and most common use case for polymorphic variants
is where ordinary variants would be sufficient but are syntactically
too heavyweight. For example, you often want to create a variant type
for encoding the inputs or outputs to a function, where it's not worth
declaring a separate type for it. Polymorphic variants are very useful
here, and as long as there are type annotations that constrain these
to have explicit, exact types, this tends to work well.

Variants are most problematic exactly where you take full advantage of
their power; in particular, when you take advantage of the ability of
polymorphic variant types to overlap in the tags they support. This
ties into OCaml's support for subtyping. As we'll discuss further when
we cover objects in [Objects](objects.html#objects){data-type=xref},
subtyping brings in a lot of complexity, and most of the time, that's
complexity you want to avoid.
