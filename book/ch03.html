<section xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="lists-and-patterns" data-type="chapter"><h1>Lists and Patterns</h1><p>This chapter will focus on two common elements of programming in
  OCaml: lists and pattern matching. Both of these were discussed in <a href="#a-guided-tour" data-type="xref">#a-guided-tour</a>, but we'll go into more depth here, presenting
  the two topics together and using one to help illustrate the other.</p><section id="list-basics" data-type="sect1"><h1>List Basics</h1><p>An OCaml list is an immutable, finite sequence of elements of the
    same type. As we've seen, OCaml lists can be generated using a
    bracket-and-semicolon notation:<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="lists" data-secondary="generation of">&#xa0;</a></p><link rel="import" data-code-language="ocamltop" href="lists-and-patterns/main.topscript"/><p>And they can also be generated using the equivalent <code>::</code> notation:<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="operators" data-secondary=": : operator">&#xa0;</a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="lists" data-secondary="operator : :">&#xa0;</a></p><link rel="import" data-code-language="ocamltop" href="lists-and-patterns/main.topscript" part="1"/><p>As you can see, the <code>::</code> operator
    is right-associative, which means that we can build up lists without
    parentheses. The empty list <code>[]</code> is used
    to terminate a list. Note that the empty list is polymorphic, meaning it
    can be used with elements of any type, as you can see here:</p><link rel="import" data-code-language="ocamltop" href="lists-and-patterns/main.topscript" part="2"/><p>The way in which the <code>::</code> operator
    attaches elements to the front of a list reflects the fact that OCaml's
    lists are in fact singly linked lists. The figure below is a
    rough graphical representation of how the list <code>1
    :: 2 :: 3 :: []</code> is laid out as a data structure. The final arrow
    (from the box containing <code>3</code>) points to
    the empty list.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="lists" data-secondary="structure of">&#xa0;</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/realworldocaml/examples/tree/v1/code/lists-and-patterns/lists_layout.ascii" class="orm:hideurl:ital"><em class="hyperlink">Diagram</em></a></p><figure style="float: 0"><img src="images/rwoc_0301.png"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Each <code>::</code> essentially adds a new block to the proceding
      picture. Such a block contains two things: a reference to the data in that list element, and a
      reference to the remainder of the list. This is why <code>::</code> can
      extend a list without modifying it; extension allocates a new list element but change any of
      the existing ones, as you can see:<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="lists" data-secondary="extension of">&#xa0;</a></p><link rel="import" data-code-language="ocamltop" href="lists-and-patterns/main.topscript" part="3"/></section><section id="using-patterns-to-extract-data-from-a-list" data-type="sect1"><h1>Using Patterns to Extract Data from a List</h1><p>We can read data out of a list using a <code>match</code>
    statement. Here's a simple example of a recursive function that computes
    the sum of all elements of a list:<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="match statements">&#xa0;</a><a data-type="indexterm" id="PATMAT" data-primary="pattern matching" data-secondary="extracting data with">&#xa0;</a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="lists" data-secondary="extracting data from">&#xa0;</a></p><link rel="import" data-code-language="ocamltop" href="lists-and-patterns/main.topscript" part="4"/><p>This code follows the convention of using <code>hd</code> to represent the first element (or head) of
    the list, and <code>tl</code> to represent the
    remainder (or tail).</p><p>The <code>match</code> statement in <code>sum</code> is really doing two things: first, it's
    acting as a case-analysis tool, breaking down the possibilities into a
    pattern-indexed list of cases. Second, it lets you name substructures
    within the data structure being matched. In this case, the variables
    <code>hd</code> and <code>tl</code> are bound by the pattern that defines the
    second case of the match statement. Variables that are bound in this way
    can be used in the expression to the right of the arrow for the pattern in
    question.</p><p>The fact that <code>match</code> statements can be used to
    bind new variables can be a source of confusion. To see how, imagine we
    wanted to write a function that filtered out from a list all elements
    equal to a particular value. You might be tempted to write that code as
    follows, but when you do, the compiler will immediately warn you that
    something is wrong:</p><link rel="import" data-code-language="ocamltop" href="lists-and-patterns/main.topscript" part="5"/><p>Moreover, the function clearly does the wrong thing, filtering out
    all elements of the list rather than just those equal to the provided
    value, as you can see here:</p><link rel="import" data-code-language="ocamltop" href="lists-and-patterns/main.topscript" part="6"/><p>So, what's going on?</p><p>The key observation is that the appearance of <code>to_drop</code> in the second case doesn't imply a check
    that the first element is equal to the value <code>to_drop</code> passed in as an argument to <code>drop_value</code>. Instead, it just causes a new
    variable <code>to_drop</code> to be bound to
    whatever happens to be in the first element of the list, shadowing the
    earlier definition of <code>to_drop</code>. The
    third case is unused because it is essentially the same pattern as we had
    in the second case.</p><p>A better way to write this code is not to use pattern matching for
    determining whether the first element is equal to <code>to_drop</code>, but to instead use an ordinary
    <code>if</code> statement:</p><link rel="import" data-code-language="ocamltop" href="lists-and-patterns/main.topscript" part="7"/><p>Note that if we wanted to drop a particular literal value (rather
    than a value that was passed in), we could do this using something like
    our original implementation of <code>drop_value</code>:</p><link rel="import" data-code-language="ocamltop" href="lists-and-patterns/main.topscript" part="8"/></section><section id="limitations-and-blessings-of-pattern-matching" data-type="sect1"><h1>Limitations (and Blessings) of Pattern Matching</h1><p>The preceding example highlights an important fact about patterns,
    which is that they can't be used to express arbitrary conditions. Patterns
    can characterize the layout of a data structure and can even include
    literals, as in the <code>drop_zero</code> example,
    but that's where they stop. A pattern can check if a list has two
    elements, but it can't check if the first two elements are equal to each
    other.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="data structures" data-secondary="pattern matching and">&#xa0;</a></p><p>You can think of patterns as a specialized sublanguage that can
    express a limited (though still quite rich) set of conditions. The fact
    that the pattern language is limited turns out to be a very good thing,
    making it possible to build better support for patterns in the compiler.
    In particular, both the efficiency of <code>match</code> statements
    and the ability of the compiler to detect errors in matches depend on the
    constrained nature of patterns.</p><section id="performance" data-type="sect2"><h2>Performance</h2><p>Naively, you might think that it would be necessary to check each
      case in a <code>match</code> in sequence to figure
      out which one fires. If the cases of a match were guarded by arbitrary
      code, that would be the case. But OCaml is often able to generate
      machine code that jumps directly to the matched case based on an
      efficiently chosen set of runtime checks.</p><p>As an example, consider the following rather silly functions for
      incrementing an integer by one. The first is implemented with a
      <code>match</code> statement, and the second with a sequence of
      <code>if</code> statements:</p><link rel="import" data-code-language="ocamltop" href="lists-and-patterns/main.topscript" part="9"/><p>Note the use of <code>_</code> in the above
      match. This is a wildcard pattern that matches any value, but without
      binding a variable name to the value in question.</p><p>If you benchmark these functions, you'll see that <code>plus_one_if</code> is considerably slower than
      <code>plus_one_match</code>, and the advantage
      gets larger as the number of cases increases. Here, we'll benchmark
      these functions using the <code>core_bench</code>
      library, which can be installed by running <code>opam
      install core_bench</code> from the command line:</p><link rel="import" data-code-language="ocamltop" href="lists-and-patterns/main.topscript" part="10"/><p>Here's another, less artificial example. We can rewrite the
      <code>sum</code> function we described earlier in
      the chapter using an <code>if</code> statement
      rather than a match. We can then use the functions <code>is_empty</code>, <code>hd_exn</code>, and <code>tl_exn</code> from the <code>List</code> module to deconstruct the list, allowing
      us to implement the entire function without pattern matching:</p><link rel="import" data-code-language="ocamltop" href="lists-and-patterns/main.topscript" part="11"/><p>Again, we can benchmark these to see the difference:</p><link rel="import" data-code-language="ocamltop" href="lists-and-patterns/main.topscript" part="12"/><p>In this case, the <code>match</code>-based
      implementation is many times faster than the <code>if</code>-based implementation. The difference comes
      because we need to effectively do the same work multiple times, since
      each function we call has to reexamine the first element of the list to
      determine whether or not it's the empty cell. With a
      <code>match</code> statement, this work happens exactly once per
      list element.</p><p>Generally, pattern matching is more efficient than the
      alternatives you might code by hand. One notable exception is matches
      over strings, which are in fact tested sequentially, so matches
      containing a long sequence of strings can be outperformed by a hash
      table. But most of the time, pattern matching is a clear performance
      win.</p></section><section id="detecting-errors" data-type="sect2"><h2>Detecting Errors</h2><p>The error-detecting capabilities of <code>match</code>
      statements are if anything more important than their performance. We've
      already seen one example of OCaml's ability to find problems in a
      pattern match: in our broken implementation of <code>drop_value</code>, OCaml warned us that the final
      case was redundant. There are no algorithms for determining if a
      predicate written in a general-purpose language is redundant, but it can
      be solved reliably in the context of patterns.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="match statements">&#xa0;</a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="errors" data-secondary="detecting with match statements">&#xa0;</a></p><p>OCaml also checks <code>match</code> statements for
      exhaustiveness. Consider what happens if we modify <code>drop_zero</code> by deleting the handler for one of
      the cases. As you can see, the compiler will produce a warning that
      we've missed a case, along with an example of an unmatched
      pattern:</p><link rel="import" data-code-language="ocamltop" href="lists-and-patterns/main.topscript" part="13"/><p>Even for simple examples like this, exhaustiveness checks are
      pretty useful. But as we'll see in <a href="#variants" data-type="xref">#variants</a>, they
      become yet more valuable as you get to more complicated examples,
      especially those involving user-defined types. In addition to catching
      outright errors, they act as a sort of refactoring tool, guiding you to
      the locations where you need to adapt your code to deal with changing
      types.<a data-type="indexterm" data-startref="PATMAT">&#xa0;</a></p></section></section><section id="using-the-list-module-effectively" data-type="sect1"><h1>Using the List Module Effectively</h1><p>We've so far written a fair amount of list-munging code using
    pattern matching and recursive functions. But in real life, you're usually
    better off using the <code>List</code> module, which
    is full of reusable functions that abstract out common patterns for
    computing with lists.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="tables, creating with List module">&#xa0;</a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="List module" data-secondary="creating tables with">&#xa0;</a><a data-type="indexterm" id="Llistmod" data-primary="lists" data-secondary="List module">&#xa0;</a></p><p>Let's work through a concrete example to see this in action. We'll
    write a function <code>render_table</code> that,
    given a list of column headers and a list of rows, prints them out in a
    well-formatted text table, as follows:</p><link rel="import" data-code-language="ocamltop" href="lists-and-patterns/main.topscript" part="69"/><p>The first step is to write a function to compute the maximum width
    of each column of data. We can do this by converting the header and each
    row into a list of integer lengths, and then taking the element-wise max
    of those lists of lengths. Writing the code for all of this directly would
    be a bit of a chore, but we can do it quite concisely by making use of
    three functions from the <code>List</code> module:
    <code>map</code>, <code>map2_exn</code>, and <code>fold</code>.</p><p><code>List.map</code> is the simplest to
    explain. It takes a list and a function for transforming elements of that
    list, and returns a new list with the transformed elements. Thus, we can
    write:<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="List module" data-secondary="List.map">&#xa0;</a></p><link rel="import" data-code-language="ocamltop" href="lists-and-patterns/main.topscript" part="14"/><p><code>List.map2_exn</code> is similar to
    <code>List.map</code>, except that it takes two
    lists and a function for combining them. Thus, we might write:<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="List module" data-secondary="List.map2_exn">&#xa0;</a></p><link rel="import" data-code-language="ocamltop" href="lists-and-patterns/main.topscript" part="15"/><p>The <code>_exn</code> is there because the
    function throws an exception if the lists are of mismatched length:</p><link rel="import" data-code-language="ocamltop" href="lists-and-patterns/main.topscript" part="16"/><p><code>List.fold</code> is the most complicated of the three, taking
      three arguments: a list to process, an initial accumulator value, and a function for updating
      the accumulator. <code>List.fold</code> walks over the list from left to
      right, updating the accumulator at each step and returning the final value of the accumulator
      when it's done. You can see some of this by looking at the type-signature for <code>fold</code>:<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="List module" data-secondary="List.fold">&#xa0;</a></p><link rel="import" data-code-language="ocamltop" href="lists-and-patterns/main.topscript" part="17"/><p>We can use <code>List.fold</code> for
    something as simple as summing up a list:</p><link rel="import" data-code-language="ocamltop" href="lists-and-patterns/main.topscript" part="18"/><p>This example is particularly simple because the accumulator and the
    list elements are of the same type. But <code>fold</code> is not limited to such cases. We can for
    example use <code>fold</code> to reverse a list, in
    which case the accumulator is itself a list:</p><link rel="import" data-code-language="ocamltop" href="lists-and-patterns/main.topscript" part="19"/><p>Let's bring our three functions together to compute the maximum
    column widths:</p><link rel="import" data-code-language="ocamltop" href="lists-and-patterns/main.topscript" part="20"/><p>Using <code>List.map</code> we define the
    function <code>lengths</code>, which converts a list
    of strings to a list of integer lengths. <code>List.fold</code> is then used to iterate over the rows,
    using <code>map2_exn</code> to take the max of the
    accumulator with the lengths of the strings in each row of the table, with
    the accumulator initialized to the lengths of the header row.</p><p>Now that we know how to compute column widths, we can write the code
    to generate the line that separates the header from the rest of the text
    table. We'll do this in part by mapping <code>String.make</code> over the lengths of the columns to
    generate a string of dashes of the appropriate length. We'll then join
    these sequences of dashes together using <code>String.concat</code>, which concatenates a list of
    strings with an optional separator string, and <code>^</code>, which is a pairwise string concatenation
    function, to add the delimiters on the outside:</p><link rel="import" data-code-language="ocamltop" href="lists-and-patterns/main.topscript" part="21"/><p>Note that we make the line of dashes two larger than the provided
    width to provide some whitespace around each entry in the table.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="strings" data-secondary="concatenation of">&#xa0;</a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="String.concat">&#xa0;</a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="List module" data-secondary="String.concat and">&#xa0;</a></p><div data-type="note"><h1>Performance of String.concat and ^</h1><p>In the preceding code we’ve concatenated strings two different
      ways: <code>String.concat</code>, which operates
      on lists of strings; and <code>^</code>, which is
      a pairwise operator. You should avoid <code>^</code> for joining long numbers of strings, since
      it allocates a new string every time it runs. Thus, the following
      code</p><link rel="import" data-code-language="ocamltop" href="lists-and-patterns/main.topscript" part="22"/><p>will allocate strings of length 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, whereas this
      code</p><link rel="import" data-code-language="ocamltop" href="lists-and-patterns/main.topscript" part="23"/><p>allocates one string of size 7, as well as a list of length 7. At
      these small sizes, the differences don't amount to much, but for
      assembling large strings, it can be a serious performance issue.</p></div><p>Now we need code for rendering a row with data in it. We'll first write a function called
        <code>pad</code>, for padding out a string to a specified length plus
      one blank space on both sides:<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="strings" data-secondary="padding of">&#xa0;</a></p><link rel="import" data-code-language="ocamltop" href="lists-and-patterns/main.topscript" part="24"/><p>We can render a row of data by merging together the padded strings.
    Again, we'll use <code>List.map2_exn</code> for
    combining the list of data in the row with the list of widths:</p><link rel="import" data-code-language="ocamltop" href="lists-and-patterns/main.topscript" part="25"/><p>Now we can bring this all together in a single function that renders
    the table:</p><link rel="import" data-code-language="ocamltop" href="lists-and-patterns/main.topscript" part="26"/><section id="more-useful-list-functions" data-type="sect2"><h2>More Useful List Functions</h2><p>The previous example we worked through touched on only three of
      the functions in <code>List</code>. We won't cover
      the entire interface (for that you should look at the <a href="http://realworldocaml.org/doc">online docs</a>), but a few more

        earlier, is a very general and powerful function. Sometimes, however,
        you want something simpler and easier to use. One such function is
        <code>List.reduce</code>, which is essentially a
        specialized version of <code>List.fold</code>
        that doesn't require an explicit starting value, and whose accumulator
        has to consume and produce values of the same type as the elements of

          the values on your list. The <code>List.filter</code> function is
          one way of doing that:<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="lists" data-secondary="filtering values in">&#xa0;</a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="values" data-secondary="filtering with List.filter">&#xa0;</a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="List module" data-secondary="List.filter">&#xa0;</a></p><link rel="import" data-code-language="ocamltop" href="lists-and-patterns/main.topscript" part="29"/><p>Note that the <code>mod</code> used above

        same computation. In that case, <code>List.filter_map</code> is what you need. The
        function passed to <code>List.filter_map</code>
        returns an optional value, and <code>List.filter_map</code> drops all elements for which
        <code>None</code> is returned.</p><p>Here's an example. The following expression computes the list of
        file extensions in the current directory, piping the results through
        <code>List.dedup</code> to remove duplicates.
        Note that this example also uses some functions from other modules,
        including <code>Sys.ls_dir</code> to get a

        allows you to have multiple subpatterns within a larger pattern. In
        this case, <code>None | Some ("",_)</code> is an

    the following code:</p><link rel="import" data-code-language="ocamltop" href="lists-and-patterns/main.topscript" part="38"/><p>The preceding example creates lists using <code>List.init</code>, which takes an integer <code>n</code> and a function <code>f</code> and creates a list of length <code>n</code>, where the data for each element is created by
    calling <code>f</code> on the index of that
    element.</p><p>To understand where the error in the above example comes from, you
    need to learn a bit more about how function calls work. Typically, a
    function call needs some space to keep track of information associated
    with the call, such as the arguments passed to the function, or the
    location of the code that needs to start executing when the function call
    is complete. To allow for nested function calls, this information is
    typically organized in a stack, where a new <em>stack
    frame</em> is allocated for each nested function call, and then
    deallocated when the function call is complete.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="stack frames">&#xa0;</a></p><p>And that's the problem with our call to <code>length</code>: it tried to allocate 10 million stack
    frames, which exhausted the available stack space. Happily, there's a way
    around this problem. Consider the following alternative
    implementation:</p><link rel="import" data-code-language="ocamltop" href="lists-and-patterns/main.topscript" part="39"/><p>This implementation depends on a helper function, <code>length_plus_n</code>, that computes the length of a
    given list plus a given <code>n</code>. In practice,
    <code>n</code> acts as an accumulator in which the
    answer is built up, step by step. As a result, we can do the additions
    along the way rather than doing them as we unwind the nested sequence of
    function calls, as we did in our first implementation of <code>length</code>.</p><p>The advantage of this approach is that the recursive call in
    <code>length_plus_n</code> is a <em>tail
    call</em>. We'll explain more precisely what it means to be a tail
    call shortly, but the reason it's important is that tail calls don't
    require the allocation of a new stack frame, due to what is called the
    <em>tail-call optimization</em>. A recursive function is said
    to be <em>tail recursive</em> if all of its recursive calls
    are tail calls. <code>length_plus_n</code> is indeed
    tail recursive, and as a result, <code>length</code>
    can take a long list as input without blowing the stack:<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="tail calls">&#xa0;</a></p><link rel="import" data-code-language="ocamltop" href="lists-and-patterns/main.topscript" part="40"/><p>So when is a call a tail call? Let's think about the situation where one function (the
        <em>caller</em>) invokes another (the <em>callee</em>). The
      invocation is considered a tail call when the caller doesn't do anything with the value
      returned by the callee except to return it. The tail-call optimization makes sense because,
      when a caller makes a tail call, the caller's stack frame need never be used again, and so you
      don't need to keep it around. Thus, instead of allocating a new stack frame for the callee,
      the compiler is free to reuse the caller's stack frame.</p><p>Tail recursion is important for more than just lists. Ordinary nontail recursive calls are
      reasonable when dealing with data structures like binary trees, where the depth of the tree is
      logarithmic in the size of your data. But when dealing with situations where the depth of the
      sequence of nested calls is on the order of the size of your data, tail recursion is usually
      the right approach.</p></section><section id="terser-and-faster-patterns" data-type="sect1"><h1>Terser and Faster Patterns</h1><p>Now that we know more about how lists and patterns work, let's
    consider how we can improve on an example from <a href="#recursive-list-functions" data-type="xref">#recursive-list-functions</a>: the function <code>destutter</code>, which removes sequential duplicates
    from a list. Here's the implementation that was described
    earlier:<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="destutter function">&#xa0;</a><a data-type="indexterm" id="PTTRNMAT" data-primary="pattern matching" data-secondary="terser and faster patterns">&#xa0;</a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="lists" data-secondary="duplicate removal">&#xa0;</a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="duplicates, removing">&#xa0;</a></p><link rel="import" data-code-language="ocamltop" href="lists-and-patterns/main.topscript" part="41"/><p>We'll consider some ways of making this code more concise and more
    efficient.</p><p>First, let's consider efficiency. One problem with the <code>destutter</code> code above is that it in some cases
    re-creates on the righthand side of the arrow a value that already existed
    on the lefthand side. Thus, the pattern <code>[hd]
    -&gt; [hd]</code> actually allocates a new list element, when really,
    it should be able to just return the list being matched. We can reduce
    allocation here by using an <code>as</code> pattern,
    which allows us to declare a name for the thing matched by a pattern or
    subpattern. While we're at it, we'll use the <code>function</code> keyword to eliminate the need for an
    explicit match:<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="function keyword">&#xa0;</a></p><link rel="import" data-code-language="ocamltop" href="lists-and-patterns/main.topscript" part="42"/><p>We can further collapse this by combining the first two cases into
    one, using an Or pattern:</p><link rel="import" data-code-language="ocamltop" href="lists-and-patterns/main.topscript" part="43"/><p>We can make the code slightly terser now by using a <code>when</code> clause. A <code>when</code> clause allows us to add an extra
    precondition to a pattern in the form of an arbitrary OCaml expression. In
    this case, we can use it to include the check on whether the first two
    elements are equal:</p><link rel="import" data-code-language="ocamltop" href="lists-and-patterns/main.topscript" part="44"/><aside data-type="sidebar"><h5>Polymorphic Compare</h5><p>In the preceding <code>destutter</code>
      example, we made use of the fact that OCaml lets us test equality
      between values of any type, using the <code>=</code> operator. Thus, we can write:</p><link rel="import" data-code-language="ocamltop" href="lists-and-patterns/main.topscript" part="45"/><p>Indeed, if we look at the type of the equality operator, we'll see
      that it is polymorphic:</p><link rel="import" data-code-language="ocamltop" href="lists-and-patterns/main.topscript" part="46"/><p>OCaml comes with a whole family of polymorphic comparison operators, including the
        standard infix comparators, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, etc., as well as the function <code>compare</code> that returns <code>-1</code>, <code>0</code>, or <code>1</code> to flag whether the
        first operand is smaller than, equal to, or greater than the second, respectively.</p><p>You might wonder how you could build functions like these yourself if OCaml didn't come
        with them built in. It turns out that you <em>can't</em> build these functions
        on your own. OCaml's polymorphic comparison functions are built into the runtime to a low
        level. These comparisons are polymorphic on the basis of ignoring almost everything about
        the types of the values that are being compared, paying attention only to the structure of
        the values as they're laid out in memory.</p><p>Polymorphic compare does have some limitations. For example, it
      will fail at runtime if it encounters a function value:</p><link rel="import" data-code-language="ocamltop" href="lists-and-patterns/main.topscript" part="47"/><p>Similarly, it will fail on values that come from outside the OCaml
      heap, like values from C bindings. But it will work in a reasonable way
      for other kinds of values.</p><p>For simple atomic types, polymorphic compare has the semantics you
      would expect: for floating-point numbers and integers, polymorphic
      compare corresponds to the expected numerical comparison functions. For
      strings, it's a lexicographic comparison.</p><p>Sometimes, however, the type-ignoring nature of polymorphic
      compare is a problem, particularly when you have your own notion of
      equality and ordering that you want to impose. We'll discuss this issue
      more, as well as some of the other downsides of polymorphic compare, in
      <a href="#maps-and-hash-tables" data-type="xref">#maps-and-hash-tables</a>.</p></aside><p>Note that <code>when</code> clauses have some
    downsides. As we noted earlier, the static checks associated with pattern
    matches rely on the fact that patterns are restricted in what they can
    express. Once we add the ability to add an arbitrary condition to a
    pattern, something will be lost. In particular, the ability of the
    compiler to determine if a match is exhaustive, or if some case is
    redundant, is compromised.</p><p>Consider the following function, which takes a list of optional
    values, and returns the number of those values that are <code>Some</code>. Because this implementation uses <code>when</code> clauses, the compiler can't tell that the
    code is exhaustive:</p><link rel="import" data-code-language="ocamltop" href="lists-and-patterns/main.topscript" part="48"/><p>Despite the warning, the function does work fine:</p><link rel="import" data-code-language="ocamltop" href="lists-and-patterns/main.topscript" part="49"/><p>If we add another redundant case without a <code>when</code> clause, the compiler will stop complaining
    about exhaustiveness and won't produce a warning about the
    redundancy.</p><link rel="import" data-code-language="ocamltop" href="lists-and-patterns/main.topscript" part="50"/><p>Probably a better approach is to simply drop the second <code>when</code> clause:</p><link rel="import" data-code-language="ocamltop" href="lists-and-patterns/main.topscript" part="51"/><p>This is a little less clear, however, than the direct
    pattern-matching solution, where the meaning of each pattern is clearer on
    its own:</p><link rel="import" data-code-language="ocamltop" href="lists-and-patterns/main.topscript" part="52"/><p>The takeaway from all of this is although <code>when</code> clauses can be useful, we should prefer
    patterns wherever they are sufficient.</p><p>As a side note, the above implementation of <code>count_some</code> is longer than necessary; even worse,
    it is not tail recursive. In real life, you would probably just use the
    <code>List.count</code> function from <code>Core</code>:</p><link rel="import" data-code-language="ocamltop" href="lists-and-patterns/main.topscript" part="53"/></section></section>
