  <h1>Installation Instructions</h1>

  <p>These instructions are aimed at readers of Real World OCaml,
  though much of what you find here will be useful for anyone who
  wants to get a good working OCaml installation.</p>

  <p>At the highest level, here's what you need to do:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Get <a href="https://opam.ocaml.org">OPAM</a> installed</li>

    <li>Build OCaml 4.06.0 or later using OPAM or your OS package manager</li>

    <li>With OPAM, install the key libraries that you need to work
    through the examples in the book</li>

    <li>Install <a href="https://github.com/diml/utop">Utop</a>, a
    modern interactive toplevel with command history, tab
    completion, and defaults that are tuned to work with the
    examples in Real World OCaml,</li>

    <li>Set up your editing environment.</li>

    <li>Optionally install <a href=
    "https://github.com/the-lambda-church/merlin">merlin</a>, a
    tool for providing IDE-like functionality like auto-completion,
    as well as <a href=
    "https://github.com/OCamlPro/ocp-indent">ocp-indent</a>, a
    source code indenter. Both work with emacs and vim, and can be
    adapted to other editors.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Note that Windows is not currently supported by the examples
  in Real World OCaml or by OPAM, although it is being worked on.
  Until that's ready, we recommend using a virtual machine running
  Debian Linux on your local machine, or
<a href="https://docker.com">Docker for Windows</a>.</p>

  <p>Let's get started.</p>

  <h2>Getting OPAM</h2>

  <p>The easiest way to install OPAM is through your OS's package
  manager. In most cases, installing OPAM will also trigger the
  installation of OCaml. The version installed isn't important,
  since we can use OPAM itself to install other versions of the
  compiler.</p>

  <p>Here are platform-specific instructions.</p>

  <h3>Mac OS X</h3>

  <p>If you don't already have a package manager set up, try
  installing homebrew. You can find information on installing
  homebrew <a href="http://brew.sh/">here</a>. make sure you have
  the latest XCode (and Command Line Tools for XCode) installed
  from the App Store first.</p>

  <p>You can then install OPAM using brew.</p>
  <pre class="command-line" data-user="rwo" data-host="lama"><code class="language-bash">
brew install opam
</code></pre>

  <p>Another popular package manager on Mac OS X is <a href=
  "http://macports.org">MacPorts</a>, which also has an OPAM
  package.</p>
  <pre class="command-line" data-user="rwo" data-host="lama"><code class="language-bash">
sudo port install opam
</code></pre>

  <h3>Ubuntu Linux</h3>

  <p>14.04 and higher comes with recent versions of OCaml  and opam. No PPA
  needed.</p>
  <pre class="command-line" data-user="rwo" data-host="lama"><code class="language-bash">
sudo apt-get install curl build-essential m4 zlib1g-dev libssl-dev ocaml ocaml-native-compilers opam
</code></pre>

  <h3>Debian Linux</h3>

  <p>Debian's OCaml packages aren't yet at 4.06.0, and so you will
  need to compile it from sources. If you are using the
  Debian 9 <code>stable</code> stream, then OPAM 1.2.2 will
  be available.</p>

  <h3>Arch Linux</h3>

  <p>OPAM is available from the AUR (Arch User Repository). You can
  install OPAM using <code>yaourt</code>:</p>
  <pre class="command-line" data-user="rwo" data-host="lama"><code class="language-bash">
sudo yaourt -S opam
</code></pre>

  <p>Or directly using <code>pacman</code>.</p>
  <pre class="command-line" data-user="rwo" data-host="lama"><code class="language-bash">
sudo pacman -S base-devel
wget https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/op/opam/opam.tar.gz
tar -xvf opam.tar.gz &amp;&amp; cd opam
makepkg
sudo pacman -U opam-&lt;version&gt;.pkg.tar.xz
</code></pre>

  <h3>Building from source</h3>

  <p>On platforms not listed above, you'll need to install OPAM
  from source, and to do that you'll need OCaml installed first.
  Some platforms, including Fedora Linux, have OCaml packages that
  you can install but not OPAM packages. You can build OPAM on
  OCaml version 4.02.1 or later.</p>

  <p>To install OCaml from source, you'll first need a C compiler,
  generally <code>gcc</code> or <code>llvm</code>.</p>

  <p>The following is enough to get OCaml installed on most
  platforms.</p>
  <pre class="command-line" data-user="rwo" data-host="lama"><code class="language-bash">
curl -OL https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/4.01.tar.gz
tar -zxvf 4.01.tar.gz
cd ocaml-4.01
./configure
make world world.opt
sudo make install
</code></pre>

  <p>If you have problems with any of the above, read the
  <code>INSTALL</code> file in the tar file.</p>

  <h4>Installing OCaml locally</h4>

  <p>The installation step described above requires administrator
  privileges. You can also install it in your home directory by
  passing the <code>prefix</code> option to the configuration
  script:</p>
  <pre class="command-line" data-user="rwo" data-host="lama"><code class="language-bash">
./configure -prefix $HOME/my-ocaml
</code></pre>

  <p>Once the installation is completed into this custom location,
  you will need to add <code>$HOME/my-ocaml/bin</code> to your
  <code>PATH</code>, normally by editing <code>~/.bashrc</code> or
  <code>~/.profile</code>. You shouldn't really do this unless you
  have special reasons, so try to install binary packages before
  trying a source installation.</p>

  <h4>Installing OPAM</h4>

  <p>If the binary packages aren't available for your system,
  you'll need to install the latest OPAM release from source. You
  can follow the online <a href=
  "http://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Quick_Install.html">quick install
  guide</a>.</p>

  <h2>Configuring OPAM</h2>

  <p>The entire OPAM package database is held in the
  <code>.opam</code> directory in your home directory, including
  compiler installations. On Linux and Mac OS X, this will be the
  <code>~/.opam</code> directory, which means you don't need
  administrative privileges to configure it. If you run into
  problems configuring OPAM, just delete the whole
  <code>~/.opam</code> directory and start over.</p>

  <p>Let's begin by initialising the OPAM package database. This
  will ask you a few interactive questions at the end. It's safe to
  answer yes to these unless you want to manually control the
  configuration steps yourself as an advanced user.</p>
  <pre class="command-line" data-user="rwo" data-host="lama" data-output="2-22"><code class="language-bash">
opam init
&lt;...&gt;
=-=-=-= Configuring OPAM =-=-=-=
Do you want to update your configuration to use OPAM ? [Y/n] y
[1/4] Do you want to update your shell configuration file ? [default: ~/.profile] y
[2/4] Do you want to update your ~/.ocamlinit ? [Y/n] y
[3/4] Do you want to install the auto-complete scripts ? [Y/n] y
[4/4] Do you want to install the `opam-switch-eval` script ? [Y/n] y
User configuration:
  ~/.ocamlinit is already up-to-date.
  ~/.profile is already up-to-date.
Gloabal configuration:
  Updating &lt;root&gt;/opam-init/init.sh
    auto-completion : [true]
    opam-switch-eval: [true]
  Updating &lt;root&gt;/opam-init/init.zsh
    auto-completion : [true]
    opam-switch-eval: [true]
  Updating &lt;root&gt;/opam-init/init.csh
    auto-completion : [true]
    opam-switch-eval: [true]
</code></pre>

  <p>You only need to run this command once, and it will create the
  <code>~/.opam</code> directory and sync with the latest package
  list from the online OPAM database.</p>

  <p>When the <code>init</code> command finishes, you'll see some
  instructions about environment variables. OPAM never installs
  files into your system directories (which would require
  administrator privileges). Instead, it puts them into your home
  directory by default, and can output a set of shell commands
  which configures your shell with the right <code>PATH</code>
  variables so that packages will just work.</p>

  <p>If you choose not to follow the OPAM instructions to add
  itself to your shell profile, you can still configure it
  on-the-fly in your current shell with just one command.</p>

  <pre class="command-line" data-user="rwo" data-host="lama"><code class="language-bash">
eval `opam config env`
  </code></pre>

  <p>This evaluates the results of running <code>opam config
  env</code> in your current shell and sets the variables so that
  subsequent commands will use them. This <em>only</em> works with
  your current shell and it can only be automated for future shells
  by adding the line to your login scripts. On Mac OS X you should
  typically use <code>~/.profile</code>, and <code>~/.bashrc</code>
  on most Linux setups.</p>

  <p>OPAM isn't unusual in this approach; the SSH
  <code>ssh-agent</code> also works similarly, so if you're having
  any problems just hunt around in your configuration scripts to
  see how that's being invoked.</p>

  <p>If you answered <code>yes</code> to the auto-complete scripts
  question during <code>opam init</code>, this should have all been
  set up for you. You can verify this worked by seeing if the
  <code>OCAML_TOPLEVEL_PATH</code> environment variable is set. You
  can do this in <code>bash</code> as follows.</p>
  <pre class="command-line" data-user="rwo" data-host="lama" data-output="2"><code class="language-bash">
printenv OCAML_TOPLEVEL_PATH
/Users/myusername/.opam/4.06.0/lib/toplevel
</code></pre>

  <p>The next step is to make sure we have the right compiler
  version installed.</p>
  <pre class="command-line" data-user="rwo" data-host="lama" data-output="2-5"><code class="language-bash">
opam switch
system  C system                      System compiler (4.00.1)
--     -- 4.04.2                      Official 4.04.2 release
--     -- 4.05.0                      Official 4.05.0 release
--     -- 4.06.0                      Official 4.06.0 release
</code></pre>

  <p>If, as in this case, your system compiler is older than
  <code>4.06.0</code>, you should install a more up to date version
  of the compiler, as shown below.</p>
  <pre class="command-line" data-user="rwo" data-host="lama"><code class="language-bash">
opam switch 4.06.0
eval `opam config env`
</code></pre>

  <p>The <code>switch</code> itself will take around ten or fifteen
  minutes on a modern machine, and will download and install the
  OCaml compiler within the <code>~/.opam</code> directory). You
  can install multiple compilers at once, and switching between
  them once they're installed is fast.</p>

  <p>The new compiler and all libraries associated with it will be
  installed in <code>~/.opam/4.01.0</code>.</p>

  <p>Finally, we're ready to install the libraries and tools we'll
  need for the book. The most important ones are <code>core</code>,
  which provides the standard library that all the examples in the
  book are based on, and <code>utop</code>, which is the
  interactive toplevel that you can use for working through the
  examples.</p>
  <pre class="command-line" data-user="rwo" data-host="lama"><code class="language-bash">
opam install core utop
</code></pre>

  <p>This will take about five or ten minutes to build, and will
  install the requested packages along with a bunch of
  dependencies. But there are other libraries that will be useful
  as you go through the book that you might as well install
  now.</p>
  <pre class="command-line" data-user="rwo" data-host="lama"><code class="language-bash">
opam install async yojson core_extended core_bench cohttp async_graphics cryptokit menhir
</code></pre>

  <p>If some of the above don't work, don't worry too much. Most of
  them come up in only a few places in the book. (There are some
  known problems right now: in particular,
  <code>core_extended</code> doesn't install cleanly on recent
  versions of OS X, due to an issue with the <code>re2</code>
  library it depends on. That is expected to be resolved soon.)</p>

  <p>Note that if you've installed <code>utop</code> and can't
  launch it from the shell, make sure you've run <code>eval `opam
  config env`</code> in this shell. In general, you should just get
  this set up as part of your shell init scripts, as described
  earlier.</p>

  <h2>Setting up and using <code>utop</code></h2>

  <p>When you first run <code>utop</code>, you'll find yourself at
  an interactive prompt with a bar at the bottom of the screen. The
  bottom bar dynamically updates as you write text, and contains
  the possible names of modules or variables that are valid at that
  point in the phrase you are entering. You can press the
  <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code> key to complete the phrase with the
  first choice.</p>

  <p>The <code>~/.ocamlinit</code> file in your home directory
  initializes <code>utop</code> with common libraries and syntax
  extensions so you don't need to type them in every time. Given
  that you have Core installed, you should update your
  <code>ocamlinit</code> to load Core every time you start
  <code>utop</code>, by adding the following lines.</p>
  <pre ><code class="language-ocaml">
#use "topfind";;
#thread;;
#require "core.top";;
#require "core.syntax";;
</code></pre>

  <p>For <code>utop</code> only you could get away with just the
  last two lines, but you need the whole thing if you want the
  traditional <code>ocaml</code> toplevel to work too.</p>

  <p>Note that <code>opam</code> will have already added some lines
  to the file. Also, notice that <code>#</code> is used to mark a
  toplevel directive, not a comment.</p>

  <p>If you want to use Core as your primary standard library, then
  you should open the <code>Core</code> module by default,
  which you can do by appending the following to the end of your
  <code>.ocamlinit</code>.</p>
  <pre><code class="language-ocaml">
open Core
</code></pre>

  <p>When you run <code>utop</code> with these initialization
  rules, it should start up with Core opened and ready to use. If
  you don't open <code>Core</code> by default, then you must
  remember to open it before running any of the interactive
  examples in the book.</p>

  <h2>Editors</h2>

  <h3>Emacs</h3>

  <p>These instructions have been tested on emacs 24.2 and should
  work for that version and newer. There are some reports of
  problems with earlier emacsen.</p>

  <p><code>tuareg</code> is the most commonly used mode for editing
  OCaml code in emacs. You can download it <a href=
  "https://github.com/ocaml/tuareg">here</a>. You should download
  it and untar it into some subdirectory of your home
  directory.</p>

  <p>Once you've done that, you can add the following rather
  lengthy snippet to your <code>.emacs</code> file.</p>
  <pre><code class="language-scheme">
;; -- common-lisp compatibility if not added earlier in your .emacs
(require 'cl)

;; -- Tuareg mode -----------------------------------------
;; Add Tuareg to your search path
(add-to-list
 'load-path
 ;; Change the path below to be wherever you've put your tuareg installation.
 (expand-file-name "~/lib/elisp/tuareg"))
(require 'tuareg)
(setq auto-mode-alist
      (append '(("\\.ml[ily]?$" . tuareg-mode))
          auto-mode-alist))

;; -- Tweaks for OS X -------------------------------------
;; Tweak for problem on OS X where Emacs.app doesn't run the right
;; init scripts when invoking a sub-shell
(cond
 ((eq window-system 'ns) ; macosx
  ;; Invoke login shells, so that .profile or .bash_profile is read
  (setq shell-command-switch "-lc")))

;; -- opam and utop setup --------------------------------
;; Setup environment variables using opam
(dolist
   (var (car (read-from-string
           (shell-command-to-string "opam config env --sexp"))))
 (setenv (car var) (cadr var)))
;; Update the emacs path
(setq exec-path (split-string (getenv "PATH") path-separator))
;; Update the emacs load path
(push (concat (getenv "OCAML_TOPLEVEL_PATH")
          "/../../share/emacs/site-lisp") load-path)
;; Automatically load utop.el
(autoload 'utop "utop" "Toplevel for OCaml" t)
(autoload 'utop-setup-ocaml-buffer "utop" "Toplevel for OCaml" t)
(add-hook 'tuareg-mode-hook 'utop-setup-ocaml-buffer)
</code></pre>

  <p>Once this successfully loads in Emacs, you can run
  <code>utop</code> by doing <code>M-x utop</code> in Emacs. You
  can also use commands like <code>Ctrl-c Ctrl-b</code> to evaluate
  your current buffer in <code>utop</code>, or <code>Ctrl-c
  Ctrl-e</code> to just evaluate a single expression.</p>

  <p>There are more detailed instructions at the <a href=
  "https://github.com/diml/utop#integration-with-emacs">utop
  homepage</a>.</p>

  <h4>Using Emacs24 packages</h4>

  <p>As an alternative to the setup above, here is a simplified
  OCaml setup using <a href="http://melpa.milkbox.net/#/">MELPA</a>
  packages.</p>

  <p>Add to <code>.emacs.d/init.el</code></p>
  <pre><code class="language-scheme">
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/") t)
</code></pre>

  <p>Now do <code>M-x package-install</code> and install
  <code>tuareg</code>, <code>utop</code> and
  <code>merlin</code>.</p>

  <p>Then add the rest of the configuration to
  <code>.emacs.d/init.el</code></p>
  <pre><code class="language-scheme">
(add-hook 'tuareg-mode-hook 'tuareg-imenu-set-imenu)
(setq auto-mode-alist
      (append '(("\\.ml[ily]?$" . tuareg-mode)
                ("\\.topml$" . tuareg-mode))
              auto-mode-alist))
(autoload 'utop-setup-ocaml-buffer "utop" "Toplevel for OCaml" t)
(add-hook 'tuareg-mode-hook 'utop-setup-ocaml-buffer)
(add-hook 'tuareg-mode-hook 'merlin-mode)
(setq merlin-use-auto-complete-mode t)
(setq merlin-error-after-save nil)
</code></pre>

  <h3>Vim</h3>

  <p>Vim users can use the built-in style, and <a href=
  "http://github.com/avsm/ocaml-annot">ocaml-annot</a> may also be
  useful. For a more richly-featured setup, see the section on
  Merlin below.</p>

  <h3>Eclipse</h3>

  <p>Eclipse is a popular IDE usually used for Java development.
  The <a href="http://ocamldt.free.fr">OCaml Development Tools
  (ODT)</a> project provides equivalent IDE features for editing
  and compiling OCaml code, such as automatic compilation and name
  completion. Installation instructions can be found <a href=
  "http://ocamldt.free.fr/spip.php?article5">here</a></p>

  <h3>Other editors</h3>

  <p>There are lots of other editors, and many of them come with
  built-in OCaml modes. These includes TextMate and Sublime Text
  for the Mac, and countless others.</p>

  <h3>Cross-editor tools</h3>

  <p>There are a number of tools that are compatible with multiple
  editors that can help you work more effectively with OCaml. Two
  of the best are <code>merlin</code> and <code>ocp-indent</code>,
  which we'll describe below. Note that these are very much
  optional. You might want to get started with the book before
  getting back to setting these up.</p>

  <h4>Merlin</h4>

  <p>Merlin provides a number of advanced IDE-like features,
  including:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>context-sensitive auto-completion</li>

    <li>interactive type-querying (i.e., you can ask it, "what is
    the type of this expression")</li>

    <li>error reporting -- it will highlight parts of your code
    that don't compile as you go.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You can install merlin with OPAM:</p>
  <pre class="command-line" data-user="rwo" data-host="lama"><code class="language-bash">
opam install merlin
</code></pre>

  <p>Then you will need to add configuration for your editor. The
  following examples assume Merlin has been installed through OPAM
  as above.</p>

  <h5>Emacs</h5>

  <p>A summary follows -- for more complete information, see
  <a href=
  "https://github.com/the-lambda-church/merlin/wiki/emacs-from-scratch">
  Merlin's Emacs documentation</a>.</p>
  <pre><code class="language-scheme">

(require 'merlin)

;; Enable Merlin for ML buffers
(add-hook 'tuareg-mode-hook 'merlin-mode)

;; Not required, but useful along with merlin-mode
(require 'auto-complete)
(add-hook 'tuareg-mode-hook 'auto-complete-mode)
</code></pre>

  <p>Here are some of the more useful key commands that merlin
  provides:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><code>C-c C-t</code>: <code>merlin-type-enclosing</code>:
    show you the type of the current expression.
    <code>C-&lt;up&gt;</code> and <code>C-&lt;down&gt;</code> can
    then be used to look at the types of enclosing expressions, or
    drill down to smaller ones.</li>

    <li><code>C-c &lt;TAB&gt;</code>: if you have auto-complete set
    up, this gives you a list of possible auto-completions, along
    with their types. You can use <code>C-s</code> to search within
    that list.</li>

    <li><code>C-c C-l</code>: to go to the definition of the value
    under your cursor.</li>

    <li><code>C-c r</code>: to restart merlin if it gets
    confused</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Vim</h5>

  <p>A summary follows -- for more complete information, see
  <a href=
  "https://github.com/the-lambda-church/merlin/wiki/vim-from-scratch">
  Merlin's Vim documentation</a> and <code>:h merlin.txt</code>
  after installing.</p>
  <pre><code class="language-vim">
" Your vimrc
filetype plugin indent on
syntax enable

" Vim needs to be built with Python scripting support, and must be
" able to find Merlin's executable on PATH.
if executable('ocamlmerlin') &amp;&amp; has('python')

  execute "set rtp+=".s:ocamlmerlin."/vim"
  execute "set rtp+=".s:ocamlmerlin."/vimbufsync"

  <p>As a one-time step after installation, index the documentation
  in Vim's help system:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-vim">
:execute "helptags " . substitute(system('opam config var share'), '\n$', '', '''')
</code></pre>

  <p>Some highlights of the functionality this enables:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Autocompletion with Vim's omnicomplete system:
    <code>&lt;C-x&gt;&lt;C-o&gt;</code></li>

    <li>Quick type checking with keybindings -- the defaults use
    <code>LocalLeader</code>, which is normally backslash
    (<code>\</code>) by default:

      <ul>
        <li><code>\t</code>: type of expression under the cursor
        (also works with a visual selection).</li>

        <li><code>\n</code> / <code>\p</code>: expand/contract the
        expression(s) to type check.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li><code>:Locate [identifier]</code>: go to the definition of
    given identifier or the one under the cursor.</li>

    <li><code>:Reload</code>: if Merlin gets confused following
    build changes like new packages.</li>

    <li><code>:GotoDotMerlin</code>: edit the <code>.merlin</code>
    project configuration (see below).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The plugin can integrate with some other popular Vim plugins
  such as Syntastic and neocomplcache -- see <code>:help
  merlin.txt</code> for pointers.</p>

  <h5>Tell Merlin about your project layout</h5>

  <p>Regardless of which editor you use, you need to tell Merlin a
  bit about the build environment you're working with in order for
  it to work properly. This is done by creating a
  <code>.merlin</code> file. If you're building applications based
  on Core and Async using the <code>corebuild</code> script (which
  is built on top of <code>ocamlbuild</code>), then the following
  is a good starting point.</p>
  <pre>
<code class="language-none">S .
B _build
PKG core
PKG async
PKG core_extended
EXT nonrec
</code></pre>

  <p>See the Merlin README for complete details of the file
  format.</p>

  <h4><a id="user-content-ocp-indent" class="anchor" href=
  "#ocp-indent" aria-hidden="true" name=
  "user-content-ocp-indent"></a>ocp-indent</h4>

  <p><code>ocp-indent</code> is a source-code indenter which
  includes a command-line tool, library and integration with emacs
  and vi. It does a better job than most editor modes, including
  tuareg, and has the advantage that it can be used as a
  command-line tool and be integrated into multiple editors, so you
