<h1>Installation Instructions</h1>

<p>These instructions are aimed at readers of Real World OCaml,
  though much of what you find here will be useful for anyone who
  wants to get a good working OCaml installation.</p>

<p>At a high level, here's what you need to do:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#install-opam">Install and set up opam</a>, OCaml's
    default package manager.</li>

  <li><a href="#libraries-and-tools">Install libraries and tools</a>,
  which you'll need for working through the examples in the book</li>

  <li><a href="#editor-setup">Set up your editor</a>, with tips for
  Visual Studio Code, Emacs, or Vim</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that Windows is not fully supported by the examples in Real
  World OCaml or by opam, though it's being worked on.  Until that's
  ready, we recommend using a virtual machine running Debian Linux on
  your local machine
  through <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install">WSL2</a>,
  or
  <a href="https://docker.com">Docker for Windows</a>.</p>

<p>Let's get started.</p>

<h2 id="install-opam">Install and set up opam</h2>

<h3>Install opam</h3>

<p>The easiest way to install opam is through your OS's package
  manager. </p>

<p>Here
  are <a href="http://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html#Using-your-distribution-39-s-package-system">
    platform-specific installation instructions</a> for installing via
  your package manager.  The same page
  has <a href="http://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html#Binary-distribution">
    instructions for using a binary installer</a> if you have trouble
  with your package manager.
</p>

<h3>Initialize opam</h3>

<p>Initialize the opam package database by running:</p>

<pre class="command-line" data-user="rwo" data-host="lama">
  <code class="language-bash">
opam init</code></pre>

<p><code>opam init</code> will ask you if you want it to adjust some
  of the config files for your shell.  We recommend you say yes here
  so as to automate adjusting the PATH environment variable of your
  shell and to prepare your environment in other ways.  Note that this
  will only take effect on a newly launched shell.</p>

<p>You can check if your environment is set up properly by
  running <code>opam switch</code> with no arguments.  It will emit a
  warning if your shell is not set up correctly, along with
  instructions on how to fix it.</p>
<pre class="command-line" data-user="rwo" data-host="lama" data-output="2-7">
  <code class="language-bash">
opam switch
#  switch                            compiler                    description
→  default                           ocaml-base-compiler.4.09.1  default

[WARNING] The environment is not in sync with the current switch.
You should run: eval $(opam env)
</code></pre>

<h3>Install the right compiler</h3>

<p>Real World OCaml requires OCaml 4.13.1.  You can use <code>opam
    switch</code> to see which version of OCaml you have installed.
  If, as shown in the above invocation of switch, you have an
  older version installed, you can use opam to install a more
  up-to-date version:</p>
<pre class="command-line" data-user="rwo" data-host="lama"><code class="language-bash">
    opam switch create 4.13.1
    eval $(opam env)
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>opam switch create</code> will take a few minutes on a
  modern machine, and will download and install the new compiler and
  all libraries associated with it. The second line is required to
  point your current shell to the new switch.</p>

<h2 id="libraries-and-tools">Installing libraries and tools</h2>

<h3>Install via opam</h3>

<p>You'll need to install <code>base</code> and <code>core</code>,
  which provide the standard library that all the examples in the book
  are based on, along with <code>utop</code>, which is the interactive
  toplevel that you can use for working through the examples.</p>

<p>Both can be installed as follows:</p>

<pre class="command-line" data-user="rwo" data-host="lama">
  <code class="language-bash">
opam install core core_bench utop
</code></pre>

<p>Other packages will come up in the book, but you can install them
  when you need them.</p>

<h3>Set up utop</h3>

<p>You should create an <code>~/.ocamlinit</code> file in your home
  directory with the following contents:</p>

<pre ><code class="language-ocaml">
#require "core.top";;
#require "ppx_jane";;
open Base;;
</code></pre>

<p> This will open the Base standard library and set up some useful
  pretty-printers and syntax extensions. Notice that <code>#</code> is
  used to mark a toplevel directive, not a comment.</p>

<h2 id="editor-setup">Set up your editor</h2>

<h3>Visual Studio Code</h3>

<p>We recommend
  the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ocamllabs.ocaml-platform">OCaml
    Platform plug-in</a>.  You'll also need an OCaml
  Language-Server-Protocol server, which you can install via opam
  following
  these <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp#installation">instructions</a>.</p>

<h3>Emacs</h3>

<p>opam comes with a <code>user-setup</code> package that can be used
  to install Emacs configs.  You can install it as follows, along with
  some related packages.</p>

<pre class="command-line" data-user="rwo" data-host="lama">
  <code class="language-bash">
opam install user-setup tuareg ocamlformat merlin
opam user-setup install</code></pre>

<!-- TODO: There are no actual emacs instructions at this link anymore -->
<p><code>user-setup</code> doesn't support <code>ocamlformat</code>
  yet, but here
  are <a href="https://ocaml.org/p/ocamlformat/0.22.4/doc/editor_setup.html#emacs-setup">
  instructions for setting up ocamlformat for emacs</a>.</p>

<h3>Vim</h3>

<p>Vim users can use the built-in style for handling OCaml source
  code.  Beyond that, Merlin and other associated tools can be
  installed as follows. </p>

<pre class="command-line" data-user="rwo" data-host="lama">
  <code class="language-bash">
opam install user-setup merlin ocamlformat
opam user-setup install</code></pre>

<!-- TODO: There are no actual VIM instructions at this link anymore -->
<p><code>user-setup</code> doesn't support ocamlformat yet, but here
  are <a href="https://ocaml.org/p/ocamlformat/0.22.4/doc/editor_setup.html#vim-setup">
  instructions for setting up ocamlformat for VIM</a>.</p>
