# Command-Line Parsing

Many of the OCaml programs that you'll write will end up as binaries that
need to be run from a command prompt. Any nontrivial command line should
support a collection of basic features:

- Parsing of command-line arguments

- Generation of error messages in response to incorrect inputs

- Help for all the available options

- Interactive autocompletion

It's tedious and error-prone to code all of this manually for every program
you write. Core provides the Command library, which simplifies all of this by
letting you declare your command-line options in one place and by deriving
all of the above functionality from these declarations. [command-line
parsing/Command library]{.idx}
[Command library]{.idx}

Command is simple to use for simple applications but also scales well as your
needs grow more complex. In particular, Command provides a sophisticated
subcommand mode that groups related commands together as the complexity of
your user interface grows. You may already be familiar with this command-line
style from the Git or Mercurial version control systems.

In this chapter, we'll:

- Learn how to use Command to construct basic and grouped command-line
  interfaces

- Build simple equivalents to the cryptographic `md5` and `shasum`
  utilities

- Demonstrate how to declare complex command-line interfaces in a type-safe
  and elegant way [combinators/functional combinators]{.idx}

## Basic Command-Line Parsing

Let's start by working through a clone of the `md5sum` command that is
present on most Linux installations (the equivalent command on macOS is
simply `md5`). The following function defined below reads in the contents of
a file, applies the MD5 one-way cryptographic hash function to the data, and
outputs an ASCII hex representation of the result: [MD5 one-way cryptographic
hash function]{.idx}[command-line parsing/basic approach to]{.idx}

```ocaml file=examples/correct/md5/md5.ml,part=0
open Core

let do_hash file =
  Md5.digest_file_blocking file |> Md5.to_hex |> print_endline
```

The `do_hash` function accepts a `filename` parameter and prints the
human-readable MD5 string to the console standard output. The first step
toward turning this function into a command-line program is to create a
parser for the command line arguments. The module `Command.Param` provides a
set of combinators that can be combined together to define a parameter parser
for optional flags and positional arguments, including documentation, the
types they should map to, and whether to take special actions such as pausing
for interactive input if certain inputs are encountered.

### Defining an Anonymous Argument {#anonymous-arguments}

Let's build a parser for a command line UI with a single *anonymous*
argument, i.e., an argument that is passed in without a flag.

```ocaml file=examples/correct/md5/md5.ml,part=1
let filename_param =
  let open Command.Param in
  anon ("filename" %: string)
```

Here, `anon` is used to signal the parsing of an anonymous argument,
and the expression `("filename" %: string)` indicates the textual name
of the argument and specification that describes the kind of value
that is expected.  The textual name is used for generating help text,
and the specification, which has type `Command.Arg_type.t`, is used
both to nail down the OCaml type of the returned value (`string`, in
this case) and to guide features like input validation. The values
`anon`, `string` and `%:` all come from the `Command.Param` module.

### Defining Basic Commands

Once we've defined a specification, we need to put it to work on real input.
The simplest way is to directly create a command-line interface with
`Command.basic`. [Command.basic]{.idx}

```ocaml file=examples/correct/md5/md5.ml,part=2
let command =
  Command.basic
    ~summary:"Generate an MD5 hash of the input data"
    ~readme:(fun () -> "More detailed information")
    (Command.Param.map filename_param ~f:(fun filename () ->
         do_hash filename))
```

The `summary` argument is a one-line description which goes at the top of the
help screen, while the (optional) `readme` argument is for providing a more
detailed description that will be provided on demand.

The final argument is the most interesting one, which is the parameter
parser. This will be easier to understand if we first learn a bit more about
the type signatures of the various components we've been using. Let's do that
by recreating some of this code in the toplevel.

```ocaml env=main
# let filename_param = Command.Param.(anon ("filename" %: string));;
val filename_param : string Command.Spec.param = <abstr>
```

\noindent
The type parameter of `filename_param` is there to indicate the type of the
value returned by the parser; in this case, `string`.

But `Command.basic` requires a parameter parser that returns a value of type
`unit -> unit`. We can see that by using `#show` to explore the types.

```ocaml env=main
# #show Command.basic;;
val basic : unit Command.basic_command
# #show Command.basic_command;;
type nonrec 'result basic_command =
    summary:string ->
    ?readme:(unit -> string) ->
    (unit -> 'result) Command.Spec.param -> Command.t
```

Note that the `'result` parameter of the type alias `basic_command` is
instantiated as `unit` for the type of `Command.basic`.

It makes sense that `Command.basic` wants a parser that returns a
function; after all, in the end, it needs a function it can run that
constitutes the execution of the program. But how do we get such a
parser, given the parser we have returns just a filename?

The answer is to use a `map` function to change the value returned by
the parser. As you can see below, the type of `Command.Param.map` is
very similar to the type of `List.map`.

```ocaml env=main
# #show Command.Param.map;;
val map : 'a Command.Spec.param -> f:('a -> 'b) -> 'b Command.Spec.param
```

In our program, we used `map` to convert the `filename_param` parser,
which returns a string representing the file name, into a parser that
returns a function of type `unit -> unit` containing the body of the
command.  It might not be obvious that the function passed to map
returns a function, but remember that, due to currying, the invocation
of map above could be written equivalently as follows.

```ocaml skip
Command.Param.map filename_param ~f:(fun filename ->
  fun () -> do_hash filename)
```


### Running Commands {#running-basic-commands}

<!-- TODO: Explain command_unix properly -->

Once we've defined the basic command, running it is just one function call
away.

```ocaml file=examples/correct/md5/md5.ml,part=3
let () = Command_unix.run ~version:"1.0" ~build_info:"RWO" command
```

`Command_unix.run` takes a couple of optional arguments that are useful to
identify which version of the binary you are running in production.
You'll need the following `dune` file:

```scheme file=examples/correct/md5/dune
(executable
  (name       md5)
  (libraries  core core_unix.command_unix)
  (preprocess (pps ppx_jane)))
```

At which point we can build and execute the program using `dune
exec`. Let's use this to query version information from the binary.

```sh dir=examples/correct/md5
$ dune exec -- ./md5.exe -version
1.0
$ dune exec -- ./md5.exe -build-info
RWO
```

The versions that you see in the output were defined via the optional
arguments to `Command_unix.run`. You can leave these blank in your own
programs or get your build system to generate them directly from your
version control system.  Dune provides a [`dune-build-info`
library](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/dune-libs.html#dune-build-info-library)
that automates this process for most common workflows.

We can invoke our binary with `-help` to see the auto-generated help.

```sh dir=examples/correct/md5
$ dune exec -- ./md5.exe -help
Generate an MD5 hash of the input data

  md5.exe FILENAME

More detailed information

=== flags ===

  [-build-info]              . print info about this build and exit
  [-version]                 . print the version of this build and exit
  [-help], -?                . print this help text and exit

```

If you supply the `filename` argument, then `do_hash` is called with the
argument and the MD5 output is displayed to the standard output.

```sh dir=examples/correct/md5
$ dune exec -- ./md5.exe md5.ml
045215e7e7891779b261851a8458b656
```

And that's all it takes to build our little MD5 utility! Here's a
complete version of the example we just walked through, made slightly
more succinct by removing intermediate variables.

```ocaml file=examples/correct/md5_succinct/md5.ml
open Core

let do_hash file =
  Md5.digest_file_blocking file |> Md5.to_hex |> print_endline

let command =
  Command.basic
    ~summary:"Generate an MD5 hash of the input data"
    ~readme:(fun () -> "More detailed information")
    Command.Param.(
      map
        (anon ("filename" %: string))
        ~f:(fun filename () -> do_hash filename))

let () = Command_unix.run ~version:"1.0" ~build_info:"RWO" command
```

### Multi-Argument Commands {#multiple-arguments}

All the examples thus far have involved a single argument, but we can of
course create multi-argument commands as well. We can make a parser for
multiple arguments by binding together simpler parsers, using the function
`Command.Param.both`. Here is its type.

```ocaml env=main
# #show Command.Param.both;;
val both :
  'a Command.Spec.param ->
  'b Command.Spec.param -> ('a * 'b) Command.Spec.param
```

`both` allows us to take two parameter parsers and combine them into a single
parser that returns the two arguments as a pair. In the following, we rewrite
our `md5` program so it takes two anonymous arguments: the first is an
integer saying how many characters of the hash to print out, and the second
is the filename.

```ocaml file=examples/correct/md5_multiarg/md5.ml
open Core

let do_hash hash_length filename =
  Md5.digest_file_blocking filename
  |> Md5.to_hex
  |> (fun s -> String.prefix s hash_length)
  |> print_endline

let command =
  Command.basic
    ~summary:"Generate an MD5 hash of the input data"
    ~readme:(fun () -> "More detailed information")
    Command.Param.(
      map
        (both
           (anon ("hash_length" %: int))
           (anon ("filename" %: string)))
        ~f:(fun (hash_length, filename) () ->
          do_hash hash_length filename))

let () = Command_unix.run ~version:"1.0" ~build_info:"RWO" command
```

Building and running this command, we can see that it now indeed expects two
arguments.

```sh dir=examples/correct/md5_multiarg
$ dune exec -- ./md5.exe 5 md5.ml
bc879
```

This works well enough for two parameters, but if you want longer parameter
lists, this approach gets old fast. A better way is to use let-syntax, which
was discussed in
[Error Handling](error-handling.html#bind-and-other-error-handling-idioms){data-type=xref}.

```ocaml file=examples/correct/md5_let_syntax/md5.ml,part=1
let command =
  Command.basic
    ~summary:"Generate an MD5 hash of the input data"
    ~readme:(fun () -> "More detailed information")
    (let open Command.Let_syntax in
    let open Command.Param in
    let%map hash_length = anon ("hash_length" %: int)
    and filename = anon ("filename" %: string) in
    fun () -> do_hash hash_length filename)
```

Here, we take advantage of let-syntax's support for parallel let bindings,
using `and` to join the definitions together. This syntax translates down to
the same pattern based on `both` that we showed above, but it's easier to
read and use, and scales better to more arguments.

The need to open both modules is a little awkward, and the `Param`
module in particular you really only need on the right-hand-side of
the equals-sign.  This is achieved automatically by using the
`let%map_open` syntax, demonstrated below.  We'll also drop the open
of `Command.Let_syntax` in favor of explicitly using
`let%map_open.Command` to mark the let-syntax as coming from the
`Command` module

```ocaml file=examples/correct/md5_let_syntax2/md5.ml,part=1
let command =
  Command.basic
    ~summary:"Generate an MD5 hash of the input data"
    ~readme:(fun () -> "More detailed information")
    (let%map_open.Command hash_length = anon ("hash_length" %: int)
     and filename = anon ("filename" %: string) in
     fun () -> do_hash hash_length filename)
```

Let-syntax is the most common way of writing parsers for `Command`,
and we'll use that idiom from here on.

Now that we have the basics in place, the rest of the chapter will examine
some of the more advanced features of Command.


## Argument Types

You aren't just limited to parsing command lines of strings and ints.
There are some other argument types defined in `Command.Param`, like
`date` and `percent`.  But most of the time, argument types for
specific types in `Core` and other associated libraries are defined in
the module that defines the type in question.  [arguments/argument
types]{.idx}[command-line parsing/argument types]{.idx}

As an example, we can tighten up the specification of the command to
`Filename.arg_type` to reflect that the argument must be a valid
filename, and not just any string.

```ocaml file=examples/correct/md5_as_filename/md5.ml,part=1
let command =
  Command.basic
    ~summary:"Generate an MD5 hash of the input data"
    ~readme:(fun () -> "More detailed information")
    (let%map_open.Command file =
       anon ("filename" %: Filename_unix.arg_type)
     in
     fun () -> do_hash file)
```

This doesn't change the validation of the provided value, but it does
enable interactive command-line completion. We'll explain how to
enable that later in the chapter.

### Defining Custom Argument Types

We can also define our own argument types if the predefined ones aren't
sufficient. For instance, let's make a `regular_file` argument type that
ensures that the input file isn't a character device or some other odd UNIX
file type that can't be fully read. [arguments/defining custom types]{.idx}

```ocaml file=examples/correct/md5_with_custom_arg/md5.ml
open Core

let do_hash file =
  Md5.digest_file_blocking file |> Md5.to_hex |> print_endline

let regular_file =
  Command.Arg_type.create (fun filename ->
      match Sys_unix.is_file filename with
      | `Yes -> filename
      | `No -> failwith "Not a regular file"
      | `Unknown ->
        failwith "Could not determine if this was a regular file")

let command =
  Command.basic
    ~summary:"Generate an MD5 hash of the input data"
    ~readme:(fun () -> "More detailed information")
    (let%map_open.Command filename =
       anon ("filename" %: regular_file)
     in
     fun () -> do_hash filename)

let () = Command_unix.run ~version:"1.0" ~build_info:"RWO" command
```

The `regular_file` function transforms a `filename` string parameter into the
same string but first checks that the file exists and is a regular file type.
When you build and run this code, you will see the new error messages if you
try to open a special device such as `/dev/null`:

```sh dir=examples/correct/md5_with_custom_arg
$ dune exec -- ./md5.exe md5.ml
6a6c128cdc8e75f3b174559316e49a5d
$ dune exec -- ./md5.exe /dev/null
Error parsing command line:

  failed to parse FILENAME value "/dev/null"
  (Failure "Not a regular file")

For usage information, run

  md5.exe -help

[1]
```

### Optional and Default Arguments

A more realistic `md5` binary could also read from the standard input if a
`filename` isn't specified. To do this, we need to declare the filename
argument as optional, which we can do with the `maybe` operator.
[arguments/default arguments]{.idx}[default arguments]{.idx}[optional
arguments/and default arguments]{.idx}[arguments/optional arguments]{.idx}

```ocaml file=examples/erroneous/md5_with_optional_file_broken/md5.ml,part=1
let command =
  Command.basic
    ~summary:"Generate an MD5 hash of the input data"
    ~readme:(fun () -> "More detailed information")
    (let%map_open.Command filename =
       anon (maybe ("filename" %: string))
     in
     fun () -> do_hash filename)
```

\noindent
But building this results in a compile-time error.

```sh dir=examples/erroneous/md5_with_optional_file_broken
$ dune build md5.exe
File "md5.ml", line 15, characters 23-31:
15 |      fun () -> do_hash filename)
                            ^^^^^^^^
Error: This expression has type string option
       but an expression was expected of type string
[1]
```

This is because changing the argument type has also changed the type of the
value that is returned by the parser. It now produces a `string option`
instead of a `string`, reflecting the optionality of the argument. We can
adapt our example to use the new information and read from standard input if
no file is specified.

```ocaml file=examples/correct/md5_with_optional_file/md5.ml
open Core

let get_contents = function
  | None | Some "-" -> In_channel.input_all In_channel.stdin
  | Some filename -> In_channel.read_all filename

let do_hash filename =
  get_contents filename
  |> Md5.digest_string
  |> Md5.to_hex
  |> print_endline

let command =
  Command.basic
    ~summary:"Generate an MD5 hash of the input data"
    ~readme:(fun () -> "More detailed information")
    (let%map_open.Command filename =
       anon (maybe ("filename" %: Filename_unix.arg_type))
     in
     fun () -> do_hash filename)

let () = Command_unix.run ~version:"1.0" ~build_info:"RWO" command
```

The `filename` parameter to `do_hash` is now a `string option` type. This is
resolved into a string via `get_contents` to determine whether to read
the standard input or a file, and then the rest of the command is similar to
our previous examples.

```sh dir=examples/correct/md5_with_optional_file
$ cat md5.ml | dune exec -- ./md5.exe
068f02a29536dbcf111e7adebb085aa1
```

Another possible way to handle this would be to supply a dash as the default
filename if one isn't specified. The `maybe_with_default` function can do
just this, with the benefit of not having to change the callback parameter
type.

The following example behaves exactly the same as the previous example, but
replaces `maybe` with `maybe_with_default`:

```ocaml file=examples/correct/md5_with_default_file/md5.ml
open Core

let get_contents = function
  | "-" -> In_channel.input_all In_channel.stdin
  | filename -> In_channel.read_all filename

let do_hash filename =
  get_contents filename
  |> Md5.digest_string
  |> Md5.to_hex
  |> print_endline

let command =
  Command.basic
    ~summary:"Generate an MD5 hash of the input data"
    ~readme:(fun () -> "More detailed information")
    (let%map_open.Command filename =
       anon (maybe_with_default "-" ("filename" %: Filename_unix.arg_type))
     in
     fun () -> do_hash filename)

let () = Command_unix.run ~version:"1.0" ~build_info:"RWO" command
```

Building and running this confirms that it has the same behavior as before.

```sh dir=examples/correct/md5_with_default_file
$ cat md5.ml | dune exec -- ./md5.exe
370616ab5fad3dd995c136f09d0adb29
```

### Sequences of Arguments

Another common way of parsing anonymous arguments is as a variable length
list. As an example, let's modify our MD5 code to take a collection of files
to process on the command line. [arguments/sequences of]{.idx}

```ocaml file=examples/correct/md5_sequence/md5.ml
open Core

let get_contents = function
  | "-" -> In_channel.input_all In_channel.stdin
  | filename -> In_channel.read_all filename

let do_hash filename =
  get_contents filename
  |> Md5.digest_string
  |> Md5.to_hex
  |> fun md5 -> printf "MD5 (%s) = %s\n" filename md5

let command =
  Command.basic
    ~summary:"Generate an MD5 hash of the input data"
    ~readme:(fun () -> "More detailed information")
    (let%map_open.Command files =
       anon (sequence ("filename" %: Filename_unix.arg_type))
     in
     fun () ->
       match files with
       | [] -> do_hash "-"
       | _ -> List.iter files ~f:do_hash)

let () = Command_unix.run ~version:"1.0" ~build_info:"RWO" command
```

The callback function is a little more complex now, to handle the extra
options. The `files` are now a `string list`, and an empty list reverts to
using standard input, just as our previous `maybe` and `maybe_with_default`
examples did. If the list of files isn't empty, then it opens up each file
and runs them through `do_hash` sequentially.

```sh dir=examples/correct/md5_sequence,non-deterministic=output
$ dune exec -- ./md5.exe /etc/services ./_build/default/md5.exe
MD5 (/etc/services) = 6501e9c7bf20b1dc56f015e341f79833
MD5 (./_build/default/md5.exe) = 6602408aa98478ba5617494f7460d3d9
```

## Adding Labeled Flags

You aren't limited to anonymous arguments on the command line. A *flag* is a
named field that can be followed by an optional argument. These flags can
appear in any order on the command line, or multiple times, depending on how
they're declared in the specification. [flags]{.idx}[command-line
parsing/labeled flags and]{.idx}

Let's add two arguments to our `md5` command that mimics the macOS
version. A `-s` flag specifies the string to be hashed directly on the
command line and `-t` runs a self-test. The complete example follows.

```ocaml file=examples/correct/md5_with_flags/md5.ml
open Core

let checksum_from_string buf =
  Md5.digest_string buf |> Md5.to_hex |> print_endline

let checksum_from_file filename =
  let contents =
    match filename with
    | "-" -> In_channel.input_all In_channel.stdin
    | filename -> In_channel.read_all filename
  in
  Md5.digest_string contents |> Md5.to_hex |> print_endline

let command =
  Command.basic
    ~summary:"Generate an MD5 hash of the input data"
    (let%map_open.Command use_string =
       flag
         "-s"
         (optional string)
         ~doc:"string Checksum the given string"
     and trial = flag "-t" no_arg ~doc:" run a built-in time trial"
     and filename =
       anon (maybe_with_default "-" ("filename" %: Filename_unix.arg_type))
     in
     fun () ->
       if trial
       then printf "Running time trial\n"
       else (
         match use_string with
         | Some buf -> checksum_from_string buf
         | None -> checksum_from_file filename))

let () = Command_unix.run command
```

The specification now uses the `flag` function to define the two new labeled,
command-line arguments. The `doc` string is formatted so that the first word
is the short name that appears in the usage text, with the remainder being
the full help text. Notice that the `-t` flag has no argument, and so we
prepend its `doc` text with a blank space. The help text for the preceding
code looks like this:

```sh dir=examples/correct/md5_with_flags
$ dune exec -- ./md5.exe -help
Generate an MD5 hash of the input data

  md5.exe [FILENAME]

=== flags ===

  [-s string]                . Checksum the given string
  [-t]                       . run a built-in time trial
  [-build-info]              . print info about this build and exit
  [-version]                 . print the version of this build and exit
  [-help], -?                . print this help text and exit

$ dune exec -- ./md5.exe -s "ocaml rocks"
5a118fe92ac3b6c7854c595ecf6419cb
```

The `-s` flag in our specification requires a `string` argument and
isn't optional. The Command parser outputs an error message if the
flag isn't supplied, as with the anonymous arguments in earlier
examples.  There are a number of other functions that you can wrap
flags in to control how they are parsed: [flag functions]{.idx}

- `required <arg>` will return `<arg>` and error if not present
- `optional <arg>` with return `<arg> option`
- `optional_with_default <val> <arg>` will return `<arg>` with default
  `<val>` if not present
- `listed <arg>` will return `<arg> list` (this flag may appear
  multiple times)
- `no_arg` will return a  `bool` that is true if the flag is present

The flags affect the type of the callback function in exactly the same way as
anonymous arguments do. This lets you change the specification and ensure
that all the callback functions are updated appropriately, without runtime
errors.

## Grouping Subcommands Together {#grouping-sub-commands-together}

You can get pretty far by using flags and anonymous arguments to assemble
complex, command-line interfaces. After a while, though, too many options can
make the program very confusing for newcomers to your application. One way to
solve this is by grouping common operations together and adding some
hierarchy to the command-line interface. [subcommands, grouping
of]{.idx}[opam package manager]{.idx}[command-line parsing/subcommand
grouping]{.idx}

You'll have run across this style already when using the opam package manager
(or, in the non-OCaml world, the Git or Mercurial commands). opam exposes
commands in this form:

```
$ opam env
$ opam remote list -k git
$ opam install --help
$ opam install core --verbose
```

The `config`, `remote`, and `install` keywords form a logical grouping of
commands that factor out a set of flags and arguments. This lets you prevent
flags that are specific to a particular subcommand from leaking into the
general configuration space. [install keyword]{.idx}[remote keyword]{.idx}

This usually only becomes a concern when your application organically grows
features. Luckily, it's simple to extend your application to do this in
Command: just use `Command.group`, which lets you merge a collection of
`Command.t`'s into one. [Command.group]{.idx}

```ocaml env=main
# Command.group;;
- : summary:string ->
    ?readme:(unit -> string) ->
    ?preserve_subcommand_order:unit ->
    ?body:(path:string list -> unit) ->
    (string * Command.t) list -> Command.t
= <fun>
```

The `group` signature accepts a list of basic `Command.t` values and
their corresponding names. When executed, it looks for the appropriate
subcommand from the name list, and dispatches it to the right command
handler.

Let's build the outline of a calendar tool that does a few operations
over dates from the command line. We first need to define a command
that adds days to an input date and prints the resulting date:

```ocaml file=examples/correct/cal_add_days/cal.ml
open Core

let add =
  Command.basic
    ~summary:"Add [days] to the [base] date and print day"
    (let%map_open.Command base = anon ("base" %: date)
     and days = anon ("days" %: int) in
     fun () ->
       Date.add_days base days |> Date.to_string |> print_endline)

let () = Command_unix.run add
```

Everything in this command should be familiar to you by now, and it works as
you might expect.

```sh dir=examples/correct/cal_add_days
$ dune exec -- ./cal.exe -help
Add [days] to the [base] date and print day

  cal.exe BASE DAYS

=== flags ===

  [-build-info]              . print info about this build and exit
  [-version]                 . print the version of this build and exit
  [-help], -?                . print this help text and exit

$ dune exec -- ./cal.exe 2012-12-25 40
2013-02-03
```

Now, let's also add the ability to take the difference between two dates,
but, instead of creating a new binary, we'll group both operations as
subcommands using `Command.group`.

```ocaml file=examples/correct/cal_add_sub_days/cal.ml
open Core

let add =
  Command.basic
    ~summary:"Add [days] to the [base] date"
    Command.Let_syntax.(
      let%map_open base = anon ("base" %: date)
      and days = anon ("days" %: int) in
      fun () ->
        Date.add_days base days |> Date.to_string |> print_endline)

let diff =
  Command.basic
    ~summary:"Show days between [date1] and [date2]"
    (let%map_open.Command date1 = anon ("date1" %: date)
     and date2 = anon ("date2" %: date) in
     fun () -> Date.diff date1 date2 |> printf "%d days\n")

let command =
  Command.group
    ~summary:"Manipulate dates"
    [ "add", add; "diff", diff ]

let () = Command_unix.run command
```

And that's all you really need to add subcommand support! Let's build the
example first in the usual way and inspect the help output, which now
reflects the subcommands we just added.

```scheme file=examples/correct/cal_add_sub_days/dune
(executable
  (name       cal)
  (libraries  core core_unix.command_unix)
  (preprocess (pps ppx_jane)))
```



```sh dir=examples/correct/cal_add_sub_days
$ dune exec -- ./cal.exe -help
Manipulate dates

  cal.exe SUBCOMMAND

=== subcommands ===

  add                        . Add [days] to the [base] date
  diff                       . Show days between [date1] and [date2]
  version                    . print version information
  help                       . explain a given subcommand (perhaps recursively)

```

We can invoke the two commands we just defined to verify that they work and
see the date parsing in action:

```sh dir=examples/correct/cal_add_sub_days
$ dune exec -- ./cal.exe add 2012-12-25 40
2013-02-03
$ dune exec -- ./cal.exe diff 2012-12-25 2012-11-01
54 days
```

## Prompting for Interactive Input

Sometimes, if a value isn't provided on the command line, you want to prompt
for it instead. Let's return to the calendar tool we built before.
[interactive input/prompts for]{.idx}

```ocaml file=examples/correct/cal_add_days/cal.ml
open Core

let add =
  Command.basic
    ~summary:"Add [days] to the [base] date and print day"
    (let%map_open.Command base = anon ("base" %: date)
     and days = anon ("days" %: int) in
     fun () ->
       Date.add_days base days |> Date.to_string |> print_endline)

let () = Command_unix.run add
```

This program requires you to specify both the `base` date and the number of
`days` to add onto it. If `days` isn't supplied on the command line, an error
is output. Now let's modify it to interactively prompt for a number of days
if only the `base` date is supplied.

```ocaml file=examples/correct/cal_add_interactive/cal.ml
open Core

let add_days base days =
  Date.add_days base days |> Date.to_string |> print_endline

let prompt_for_string name of_string =
  printf "enter %s: %!" name;
  match In_channel.input_line In_channel.stdin with
  | None -> failwith "no value entered. aborting."
  | Some line -> of_string line

let add =
  Command.basic
    ~summary:"Add [days] to the [base] date and print day"
    (let%map_open.Command base = anon ("base" %: date)
     and days = anon (maybe ("days" %: int)) in
     let days =
       match days with
       | Some x -> x
       | None -> prompt_for_string "days" Int.of_string
     in
     fun () -> add_days base days)

let () = Command_unix.run add
```

The `days` anonymous argument is now an optional integer in the spec, and
when it isn't there, we simply prompt for the value as part of the ordinary
execution of our program.

Sometimes, it's convenient to pack the prompting behavior into the parser
itself. For one thing, this would allow you to easily share the prompting
behavior among multiple commands. This is easy enough to do by adding a new
function, `anon_prompt`, which creates a parser that automatically prompts if
the value isn't provided.

```ocaml file=examples/correct/cal_add_interactive2/cal.ml,part=1
let anon_prompt name of_string =
  let arg = Command.Arg_type.create of_string in
  let%map_open.Command value = anon (maybe (name %: arg)) in
  match value with
  | Some v -> v
  | None -> prompt_for_string name of_string

let add =
  Command.basic
    ~summary:"Add [days] to the [base] date and print day"
    (let%map_open.Command base = anon ("base" %: date)
     and days = anon_prompt "days" Int.of_string in
     fun () -> add_days base days)
```

We can see the prompting behavior if we run the program without providing the
second argument.

```sh dir=examples/correct/cal_add_interactive2
$ echo 35 | dune exec -- ./cal.exe 2013-12-01
enter days: 2014-01-05
```

## Command-Line Autocompletion with bash {#command-line-auto-completion-with-bash}

Modern UNIX shells usually have a tab-completion feature to
interactively help you figure out how to build a command line. These
work by pressing the Tab key in the middle of typing a command, and
seeing the options that pop up. You've probably used this most often
to find the files in the current directory, but it can actually be
extended for other parts of the command,
too. [autocompletion]{.idx}[command-line parsing/autocompletion with
bash]{.idx}

The precise mechanism for autocompletion varies depending on what shell you
are using, but we'll assume you are using the most common one: `bash`. This
is the default interactive shell on most Linux distributions and macOS,
but you may need to switch to it on *BSD or Windows (when using Cygwin). The
rest of this section assumes that you're using `bash`. [bash
autocompletion]{.idx}

Bash autocompletion isn't always installed by default, so check your OS
package manager to see if you have it available.

- On Debian Linux, do `apt install bash-completion`
- On macOS Homebrew, do `brew install bash-completion`
- On FreeBSD, do `pkg install bash-completion`.

Once *bash* completion is installed and configured, check that it works by
typing the `ssh` command and pressing the Tab key. This should show you the
list of known hosts from your *~/.ssh/known_hosts* file. If it lists some
hosts that you've recently connected to, you can continue on. If it lists the
files in your current directory instead, then check your OS documentation to
configure completion correctly.

One last bit of information you'll need to find is the location of the
<em class="filename">bash_completion.d</em> directory. This is where all the
shell fragments that contain the completion logic are held. On Linux, this is
often in <em class="filename">/etc/bash_completion.d</em>, and in Homebrew on
macOS, it would be
<em class="filename">/usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d</em> by default.

### Generating Completion Fragments from Command

The Command library has a declarative description of all the possible valid
options, and it can use this information to generate a shell script that
provides completion support for that command. To generate the fragment, just
run the command with the `COMMAND_OUTPUT_INSTALLATION_BASH` environment
variable set to any value.

For example, let's try it on our MD5 example from earlier, assuming that the
binary is called `md5` in the current directory:

```sh dir=examples/correct/md5_with_flags,non-deterministic=output
$ env COMMAND_OUTPUT_INSTALLATION_BASH=1 dune exec -- ./md5.exe
function _jsautocom_32087 {
  export COMP_CWORD
  COMP_WORDS[0]=./md5.exe
  if type readarray > /dev/null
  then readarray -t COMPREPLY < <("${COMP_WORDS[@]}")
  else IFS="
" read -d "" -A COMPREPLY < <("${COMP_WORDS[@]}")
  fi
}
complete -F _jsautocom_32087 ./md5.exe
```

Recall that we used the `Arg_type.file` to specify the argument type. This
also supplies the completion logic so that you can just press Tab to complete
files in your current directory.

### Installing the Completion Fragment

You don't need to worry about what the preceding output script actually does
(unless you have an unhealthy fascination with shell scripting internals,
that is). Instead, redirect the output to a file in your current directory
and source it into your current shell:

```
$ env COMMAND_OUTPUT_INSTALLATION_BASH=1 ./cal_add_sub_days.native > cal.cmd
$ . cal.cmd
$ ./cal_add_sub_days.native <tab>
add      diff     help     version
```

Command completion support works for flags and grouped commands and is very
useful when building larger command-line interfaces. Don't forget to install
the shell fragment into your global
<em class="filename">bash_completion.d</em> directory if you want it to be
loaded in all of your login shells. [completion handlers]{.idx}

::: {data-type=note}
#### Installing a Generic Completion Handler

Sadly, `bash` doesn't support installing a generic handler for all
Command-based applications. This means you have to install the completion
script for every application, but you should be able to automate this in the
build and packaging system for your application.

It will help to check out how other applications install tab-completion
scripts and follow their lead, as the details are very OS-specific.

## Alternative Command-Line Parsers

This rounds up our tour of the Command library. This isn't the only way to
parse command-line arguments of course; there are several alternatives
available on opam. Three of the most prominent ones follow:
[command-line parsing/alternatives to Command library]{.idx}

The `Arg` module
: The `Arg` module is from the OCaml standard library, which is used
  by the compiler itself to handle its command-line
  interface. `Command` is built on top of `Arg`, but you can also use
  `Arg` directly. You can use the `Command.Spec.flags_of_args_exn`
  function to convert `Arg` specifications into ones compatible with
  Command, which is a simple way of porting an `Arg`-based command
  line interface to `Command`.
  [Arg module]{.idx}

[ocaml-getopt](https://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/ocaml-getopt/)
: `ocaml-getopt` provides the general command-line syntax of GNU `getopt` and
  `getopt_long`. The GNU conventions are widely used in the open source
  world, and this library lets your OCaml programs obey the same rules.
  [ocaml-getopt]{.idx}

[Cmdliner](http://erratique.ch/software/cmdliner)
: Cmdliner is a mix between the Command and Getopt libraries. It allows for
  the declarative definition of command-line interfaces but exposes a more
  `getopt`-like interface. It also automates the generation of UNIX man pages
  as part of the specification. Cmdliner is the parser used by opam to manage
  its command line. [Cmdliner library]{.idx}
