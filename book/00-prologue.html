      <h1>Why OCaml?</h1>

      <p>Programming languages matter. They affect the reliability,
      security, and efficiency of the code you write, as well as
      how easy it is to read, refactor, and extend. The languages
      you know can also change how you think, influencing the way
      you design software even when you're not using them.</p>

      <p>We wrote this book because we believe in the importance of
      programming languages, and that OCaml in particular is an
      important language to learn. The three of us have been using
      OCaml in our academic and professional lives for over 15
      years, and in that time we've come to see it as a secret
      weapon for building complex software systems. This book aims
      to make this secret weapon available to a wider audience, by
      providing a clear guide to what you need to know to use OCaml
      effectively in the real world.</p>

      <p>What makes OCaml special is that it occupies a sweet spot in
      the space of programming language designs. It provides a
      combination of efficiency, expressiveness and practicality that
      is matched by no other language. That is in large part because
      OCaml is an elegant combination of a set of language features
      that have been developed over the last 40 years. These include:

	<idx>OCaml/key features of</idx> </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><em>Garbage collection</em> for automatic memory
          management, now a feature of almost every modern,
          high-level language.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><em>First-class functions</em> that can be passed
          around like ordinary values, as seen in JavaScript,
          Common Lisp, and C#.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><em>Static type-checking</em> to increase performance
          and reduce the number of runtime errors, as found in Java
          and C#.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><em>Parametric polymorphism</em>, which enables the
          construction of abstractions that work across different
          data types, similar to generics in Java and C# and
          templates in <span class="keep-together">C++.</span></p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Good support for <em>immutable
          programming</em>, <em>i.e.</em>, programming without making
          destructive updates to data structures. This is present in
          traditional
          functional <span class="keep-together">languages</span> like
          Scheme, and is also found in distributed, big-data
          frameworks like Hadoop.</p>
        </li>

        <li> <p>
	    <em>Type inference</em>, so you don't need to annotate
	    every single variable in your program with its type.
	    Instead, types are inferred based on how a value is used.
	    Available in a limited form in C# with implicitly typed
	    local variables, and in C++11 with its <code>auto</code>
	    keyword.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><em>Algebraic data types</em> and <em>pattern
          matching</em> to define and manipulate complex data
          structures. Available in Scala and F#.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Some of you will know and love all of these features, and for
      others they'll be largely new, but most of you will have seen
      some of them in other languages that you've used. As we'll
      demonstrate over the course of this book, there is something
      transformative about having all these features together and able
      to interact in a single language. Despite their importance,
      these ideas have made only limited inroads into mainstream
      languages, and when they do arrive there, like first-class
      functions in C# or parametric polymorphism in Java, it's
      typically in a limited and awkward form. The only languages that
      completely embody these ideas are <em>statically typed,
      functional programming languages</em> like OCaml, F#, Haskell,
      Scala, and Standard ML.<idx>OCaml/benefits of</idx></p>

      <p>Among this worthy set of languages, OCaml stands apart
      because it manages to provide a great deal of power while
      remaining highly pragmatic. The compiler has a
      straightforward compilation strategy that produces performant
      code without requiring heavy optimization and without the
      complexities of dynamic just-in-time (JIT) compilation. This,
      along with OCaml's strict evaluation model, makes runtime
      behavior easy to predict. The garbage collector is
      <em>incremental</em>, letting you avoid large garbage
      collection (GC)-related pauses, and <em>precise</em>, meaning
      it will collect all unreferenced data (unlike many
      reference-counting collectors), and the runtime is simple and
      highly portable.</p>

      <p>All of this makes OCaml a great choice for programmers who
      want to step up to a better programming language, and at the
      same time get practical work done.</p>

      <section id="a-brief-history" data-type="sect2">
        <h2>A Brief History</h2>

        <p>OCaml was written in 1996 by Xavier Leroy, Jérôme
        Vouillon, Damien Doligez, and Didier Rémy at INRIA in
        France. It was inspired by a long line of research into ML
        starting in the 1960s, and continues to have deep links to
        the academic community.<idx>OCaml/history of</idx></p>

        <p>ML was originally the <em>meta language</em> of the LCF
        (Logic for Computable Functions) proof assistant released
        by Robin Milner in 1972 (at Stanford, and later at
        Cambridge). ML was turned into a compiler in order to make
        it easier to use LCF on different machines, and it was
        gradually turned into a full-fledged system of its own by
        the 1980s.</p>

        <p>The first implementation of Caml appeared in 1987. It
        was created by Ascánder Suárez and later continued by
        Pierre Weis and Michel Mauny. In 1990, Xavier Leroy and
        Damien Doligez built a new implementation called Caml Light
        that was based on a bytecode interpreter with a fast,
        sequential garbage collector. Over the next few years
        useful libraries appeared, such as Michel Mauny's syntax
        manipulation tools, and this helped promote the use of Caml
        in education and research teams.</p>

        <p>Xavier Leroy continued extending Caml Light with new
        features, which resulted in the 1995 release of Caml
        Special Light. This improved the executable efficiency
        significantly by adding a fast native code compiler that
        made Caml's performance competitive with mainstream
        languages such as C++. A module system inspired by Standard
        ML also provided powerful facilities for abstraction and
        made larger-scale programs easier to construct.</p>

        <p>The modern OCaml emerged in 1996, when a powerful and
        elegant object system was implemented by Didier Rémy and
        Jérôme Vouillon. This object system was notable for
        supporting many common object-oriented idioms in a
        statically type-safe way, whereas the same idioms required
        runtime checks in languages such as C++ or Java. In 2000,
        Jacques Garrigue extended OCaml with several new features
        such as polymorphic methods, variants, and labeled and
        optional arguments.</p>

        <p>The last decade has seen OCaml attract a significant
        user base, and language improvements have been steadily
        added to support the growing commercial and academic
        <span class="keep-together">codebases</span>. First-class
        modules, Generalized Algebraic Data Types (GADTs), and
        dynamic linking have improved the flexibility of the
        language. There is also fast native code support for
        x86_64, ARM, PowerPC, and Sparc, making OCaml a good choice
        for systems where resource usage, predictability, and
        performance all matter.</p>

      <section id="the-core-standard-library" data-type="sect2">
        <h2>The <code>Base</code> Standard Library</h2>

        <p>A language on its own isn't enough. You also need a rich
          set of libraries to build your applications on. A common
          source of frustration for those learning OCaml is that the
          standard library that ships with the compiler is limited,
          covering only a subset of the functionality you would expect
          from a general-purpose standard library. That's because the
          standard library isn't really a general-purpose tool; its
          fundamental role is in bootstrapping the compiler, and has
          been purposefully kept small and simple.</p>

        <p>Happily, in the world of open source software, nothing
          stops alternative libraries from being written to supplement
          the compiler-supplied standard library, and this is exactly
          what <code>Base</code> is.

	  <idx>Base standard library</idx>
	</p>

        <p>Jane Street, a company that has been using OCaml for
          more than 15 years, developed the code in <code>Base</code>
          for its own internal use, but from the start designed it
          with an eye toward being a general-purpose standard
          library. Like the OCaml language itself, <code>Base</code>
          is engineered with correctness, reliability, and performance
          in mind.  It's also designed to be easy to install and
          highly portable, available on every platform OCaml is,
          including UNIX, Mac, Windows, and JavaScript.
	</p>

	<p>
	  <code>Base</code> is distributed with a set of syntax
	  extensions that provide useful new functionality to OCaml,
	  and there are additional libraries that are designed to work
	  well with it, including <code>Core</code>, an extension
	  to <code>Base</code> that includes more significantly more
	  functionality, including UNIX-specific calls,
	  and <code>Async</code>, a library for doing concurrent
	  programming such as GUIs or networked applications. All of
	  these libraries are distributed under a
          liberal Apache 2 license to permit free use in hobby,
          academic, and commercial settings.

      <section id="the-ocaml-platform" data-type="sect2">
        <h2>The OCaml Platform</h2>

        <p><code>Base</code> is a comprehensive and effective standard
        library, but there's much more OCaml software out there. A
        large community of programmers has been using OCaml since its
        first release in 1996, and has generated many useful libraries
        and tools. We'll introduce some of these libraries in the
        course of the examples presented in the
        book.<idx>OCaml/third-party libraries for</idx></p>

        <p>The installation and management of these third-party
        libraries is made much easier via a package management tool
        known as <a href="http://opam.ocaml.org/">OPAM</a>. We'll
        explain more about OPAM as the book unfolds, but it forms the
        basis of the Platform, which is a set of tools and libraries
        that, along with the OCaml compiler, lets you build real-world
        applications quickly and effectively.</p>

        <p>We'll also use OPAM for installing
        the <span class="command"><em>utop</em></span> command-line
        interface. This is a modern interactive tool that supports
        command history, macro expansion, module completion, and other
        niceties that make it much more pleasant to work with the
        language. We'll be
        using <span class="command"><em>utop</em></span> throughout
        the book to let you step through the examples
        interactively.</p>

    <section id="about-this-book" data-type="sect1">
      <h1>About This Book</h1>

      <p><em>Real World OCaml</em> is aimed at programmers who have
      some experience with conventional programming languages, but
      not specifically with statically typed functional
      programming. Depending on your background, many of the
      concepts we cover will be new, including traditional
      functional-programming techniques like higher-order functions
      and immutable data types, as well as aspects of OCaml's
      powerful type and module systems.</p>

      <p>If you already know OCaml, this book may surprise you.
      Core redefines most of the standard namespace to make better
      use of the OCaml module system and expose a number of
      powerful, reusable data structures by default. Older OCaml
      code will still interoperate with Core, but you may need to
      adapt it for maximal benefit. All the new code that we write
      uses Core, and we believe the Core model is worth learning;
      it's been successfully used on large, multimillion-line
      codebases and removes a big barrier to building sophisticated
      applications in OCaml.</p>

      <p>Code that uses only the traditional compiler standard
      library will always exist, but there are other online
      resources for learning how that works. <em>Real World
      OCaml</em> focuses on the techniques the authors have used in
      their personal experience to construct scalable, robust
      software systems.</p>

      <section id="what-to-expect" data-type="sect2">
        <h2>What to Expect</h2>

        <p><em>Real World OCaml</em> is split into three parts:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Part I covers the language itself, opening with a
            guided tour designed to provide a quick sketch of the
            language. Don't expect to understand everything in the
            tour; it's meant to give you a taste of many different
            aspects of the language, but the ideas covered there
            will be explained in more depth in the chapters that
            follow.</p>

            <p>After covering the core language, Part I then moves
            onto more advanced features like modules, functors, and
            objects, which may take some time to digest.
            Understanding these concepts is important, though.
            These ideas will put you in good stead even beyond
            OCaml when switching to other modern languages, many of
            which have drawn inspiration from ML.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Part II builds on the basics by working through
            useful tools and techniques for addressing common
            practical applications, from command-line parsing to
            asynchronous network programming. Along the way, you'll
            see how some of the <span class="keep-together">concepts</span> from Part I are glued
            together into real libraries and tools that combine
            different features of the language to good effect.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Part III discusses OCaml's runtime system and
            compiler toolchain. It is remarkably simple when
            compared to some other language implementations (such
            as Java's or .NET's CLR). Reading this part will enable
            you to build very-high-performance systems, or to
            interface with C libraries. This is also where we talk
            about profiling and debugging techniques using tools
            such as GNU <span class="command"><em>gdb</em></span>.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="installation-instructions" data-type="sect2">
        <h2>Installation Instructions</h2>

        <p><em>Real World OCaml</em> uses some tools that we've
        developed while writing this book. Some of these resulted
        in improvements to the OCaml compiler, which means that you
        will need to ensure that you have an up-to-date development
        environment (using the 4.05.0 version of the compiler). The
        installation process is largely automated through the OPAM
        package manager. Instructions on how to it set up and what
        packages to install can be found at <a href="http://realworldocaml.org/install">this Real World OCaml

        <p><code>Core</code> requires a UNIX based operating
        system, and so only works on systems like Mac OS X, Linux,
        FreeBSD, and OpenBSD. Core includes a portable subset
        called <code>Core_kernel</code> which works anywhere OCaml
        is, and in particular works on Windows and Javascript. The
        examples in Part I of the book will only use
        <code>Core_kernel</code> and other highly portable
        libraries.</p><idx>OCaml/operating system support</idx>

        <p>This book is not intended as a reference manual. We aim
        to teach you about the language and about libraries tools
        and techniques that will help you be a more effective OCaml
        programmer. But it's no replacement for API documentation
        or the OCaml manual and man pages. You can find
