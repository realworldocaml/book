# The OCaml Platform

So far in Part II, we've gone through a number of libraries and
techniques you can use to build larger scale OCaml programs.  We'll
now wrap up this part by examining the tools you can use for editing,
compiling, testing, documenting and publishing your own projects.

The OCaml community has developed a suite of modern tools to interface
it with IDEs such as Visual Studio Code, and to generate API
documentation and implement modern software engineering practices such
as continuous integration (CI) and unit or fuzz testing.  All you need
to do is to specify your project metadata (for example, library
dependencies and compiler versions), and the OCaml Platform tools that
we'll describe next will do much of the heavy lifting.

::: {data-type=note}
#### Using the Opam Source-Based Package Manager

opam is the official package manager and metadata packaging format
that is used in the OCaml community.  We've been using it in earlier
chapters to install OCaml libraries, and we're going to take a closer
look at how to use opam within a full project next.  You've almost
certainly done this already at this point in the book, but in case
you've skipped straight to this chapter make sure you first initialize
opam's global state.[opam package manager/initializing]{.idx}

```
$ opam init
```

By default, opam doesn't require any special user permissions and
stores all of the files it installs in `~/.opam`, such as the current
build of the OCaml compiler if you didn't have one pre-installed when
you initialized opam.

You can maintain multiple development environments with different packages
and compilers installed, each of which is called a "switch" -- the default
one can be found under `~/.opam/default`.[opam package manager/listing switches]{.idx}
Run `opam switch` to see all the different sandboxed environments you have
available:

```sh skip
$ opam switch
#  switch    compiler      description
   default   ocaml.4.14.1  default
```

:::

## A Hello World OCaml Project

Let's start by creating a sample OCaml project and navigating around
it.  Dune has a basic built-in command to initialize a project
template that is suitable to get us started.[dune/initializing a project]{.idx}


```sh dir=examples/correct/hello,skip
$ dune init proj hello
Success: initialized project component named hello
```

Dune will create a `hello/` directory and populate it with a skeleton OCaml
project.  This sample project has the basic metadata required for us to learn
more about the opam package manager and the dune build tool that we've used
earlier in the book.

### Setting Up an Opam Local Switch

The next thing we need is a suitable environment for this project,
with dune and any other library dependencies available.  The best way
to do this is to create a new opam sandbox, via the `opam switch
create` command.  If you specify a project directory argument to this
command, then it creates a "local switch" that stores all the
dependencies within that directory rather than under `~/.opam`.  This
is a convenient way to keep all your build dependencies and source
code in one place on your filesystem.  [opam package manager/local
switch]{.idx}

Let's make a local switch for our hello world project now:
[opam package manager/creating a local switch]{.idx}

```sh skip
$ cd hello
$ opam switch create .
```

This invokes opam to install the project dependencies (in this case, just the
OCaml compiler and dune as we didn't specify any more when initializing the
project).  All of the files from the local switch will be present under `_opam/`
in the working directory. You can find the dune binary that was just
compiled inside that directory, for example:

```sh skip
$ ./_opam/bin/dune --version
3.0.2
```

Since opam will install other binaries and libraries in the local switch as
your project grows, you will need to add the switch to your command-line path.
You can use `opam env` to add the right directories to your local shell path so
that you can invoke the locally installed tools:

```
$ eval $(opam env)
```

If you prefer not to modify your shell configuration, then you can also invoke
commands via `opam exec` to modify the path for the subcommand specified in the
remainder of the command line.

```
$ opam exec -- dune build
```

This executes `dune build` with the opam environment variables added to the
command invocation, so it will pick up the locally built dune from your
project.  The double dash in the command line is a common Unix convention that
tells opam to stop parsing its own optional arguments for the remainder of the
command, so that they don't interfere with the command that is being executed.

### Choosing an OCaml Compiler Version

When creating a switch, opam analyses the project dependencies
and selects the newest OCaml compiler that is compatible with them.
Sometimes though, you will want to select a specific version of the OCaml
compiler, perhaps to ensure reproducibility or to use a particular feature.
You can use `opam switch list-available` to get a full list of all the
compilers that are available.

```
ocaml-system         4.14.1          The OCaml compiler
                                     (system version, from outside
                                      of opam)
ocaml-base-compiler  4.14.1          Official release 4.14.1
ocaml-variants       4.14.1+options  Official release of OCaml 4.14.1
```

You'll find many more versions present than the snippet above, but notice that
there are three different types of OCaml compiler packages present.

`ocaml-system` is the name opam uses for the pre-existing version
of the OCaml compiler that was already installed on your machine.  This
compiler is always fast to install since nothing needs to be compiled for it.
The only thing needed to create a system switch is to have the right version of
OCaml already installed (e.g. via `apt` or Homebrew) and to pass the same
version to the switch creation as an additional argument.

For example, if you have OCaml 4.14.1 installed, then running this
command will use the system compiler:

```
$ opam switch create . 4.14.1
```

On the other hand, if you didn't have that system compiler installed, then the
compiler will need to be built from scratch. The command above would select the
`ocaml-base-compiler` package in this case, which contains the full OCaml
compiler source code.  It will take a little longer than `ocaml-system`, but
you have much more flexibility about the choice of versions.  The default
operation of `opam switch create` is to calculate the latest supported compiler
version from your project metadata and use that one for the local switch.

If you always want to locally install a particular compiler, then you can
refine the package description:

```
$ opam switch create . ocaml-base-compiler.4.14.1
```

Sometimes, you will also need to add custom configuration options to
the compiler, such as the `flambda` optimiser. There are two packages
that handle this: `ocaml-variants` is a package that detects the
presence of various `ocaml-option` packages to activate configuration
flags.  For example, to build a compiler with `flambda`, you would:

```sh skip
$ opam switch create . ocaml-variants.4.14.1+options ocaml-option-flambda
```

You can specify multiple `ocaml-option` packages to cover all the
customization your project needs. See the full set of option packages
by using:

```sh skip
$ opam search ocaml-option
```

### Structure of an OCaml Project

Back in [Files Modules And
Programs](files-modules-and-programs.html#files-modules-and-programs){data-type=xref},
we looked at what a simple program with a couple of OCaml modules
looks like. Let's now look at the set of files in our `hello/`
application to examine a fuller project structure.

```
.
|-- dune-project
|-- hello.opam
|-- lib
|   |-- dune
|-- bin
|   |-- dune
|   `-- main.ml
`-- test
    |-- dune
    `-- hello.ml
```

Some observations about this structure:

- The `dune-project` file marks the root of the project, and is used
  for writing down some key metadata for the project (more on that
  later).

- The `hello.opam` file contains metadata for registering this
  software as an opam project. As we'll see, we won't need to edit
  this manually because we can generate the file via `dune`.

- There are three source directories, each with its own `dune` file
  specifying the build parameters for that part of the codebase.  The
  trio of `lib`, `bin` and `test` makes good sense for a project that
  is primarily an executable, rather than a reusable library.  In that
  case, you would might use these directories as follows:

  - The `lib` directory would contain the bulk of the source.
  - The `bin` directory would contain a thin wrapper on top of the
    code in `lib` which actually launches the executable.
  - The `test` directory has the bulk of the tests for `lib`, which,
    following the advice in
    [Testing](testing.html#where-should-tests-go){data-type=xref}, are
    in a separate directory from the source.

Now we'll talk about the different parts of this structure in more
detail.

### Defining Module Names

A matching pair of `ml` and `mli` files define an OCaml module, named
after the file and capitalized.  Module names are the only kind of
name you refer to within OCaml code.

Let's create a `Msg` module in our skeleton project inside `lib/`.

```
$ echo 'let greeting = "Hello World"' > lib/msg.ml
$ echo 'val greeting : string' > lib/msg.mli
```

A valid OCaml module name cannot contain dashes or other special
characters other than underscores. If you need to refresh your memory
about how files and modules interact, refer back to
[Files Modules And Programs](files-modules-and-programs.html#files-modules-and-programs){data-type=xref}.

### Defining Libraries as Collections of Modules

One or more OCaml modules can be gathered together into a *library*,
providing a convenient way to package up multiple dependencies with a
single name. A project usually puts the business logic of the
application into a library rather than directly into an executable
binary, since this makes writing tests and documentation easier in
addition to improving reusability.  [libraries/defining
libraries]{.idx}

Libraries are defined by putting a `dune` file into a directory, such
as the one generated for us in `lib/dune`:

```scheme
(library
 (name hello))
```

Dune will treat all OCaml modules in that directory as being part of the
`hello` library (this behavior can be overridden by a `modules` field for more
advanced projects).
By default, dune also exposes libraries as *wrapped* under a single OCaml module,
and the `name` field determines the name of that module.

In our example project, `msg.ml` is defined in `lib/dune` which defines a
`hello` library.
Thus, users of our newly defined module can access it as
`Hello.Msg`.  You can read more about wrapping and module aliases in [The
Compiler Frontend Parsing And Type
Checking](compiler-frontend.html#wrapping-libraries-with-module-aliases){data-type=xref}.
Although our `hello` library only currently contains a single `Msg` module, it
is common to have multiple modules per library in larger projects. Other
modules within the `hello` library can simply refer to `Msg`.

You must refer to library names in a `dune` file when deciding what libraries
to link in, and never individual module names.  You can query the installed
libraries in your current switch via `ocamlfind list` at your command prompt,
after running `opam install ocamlfind` to install it if necessary:

```sh skip
$ ocamlfind list
afl-persistent      (version: 1.2)
alcotest            (version: 1.5.0)
alcotest.engine     (version: 1.5.0)
alcotest.stdlib_ext (version: 1.5.0)
angstrom            (version: 0.15.0)
asn1-combinators    (version: 0.2.6)
...
```

If there's a `public_name` field present in the `dune` library definition, this
determines the publicly exposed name for the library. The public library name
is what you specify via the `libraries` field in other projects that use your
project's libraries.  Without a public name, the defined library is local to
the current dune project only.  The `(libraries)` field in the `lib/dune` file
is empty since this is a trivial standalone library.

### Writing Test Cases for a Library

Our next step is to define a test case in `test/dune` for our library.
In [Testing](testing.html#testing){data-type=xref}, we showed you how
to embed tests within a library, using the inline test mechanism.
In this section, we'll show you how to use dune's `test` stanza to
create a test-only executable, which is useful when you're not using
inline tests.

Let's start by writing a test as a simple assertion in `test/hello.ml`.

<!-- $MDX file=examples/correct/hello/test/hello.ml -->
```
let () = assert (String.equal Hello.Msg.greeting "Hello World")
```

We can use the `test` dune stanza to build an executable binary that
is run when you invoke `dune runtest` (along with any inline tests
defined within libraries).  We'll also add a dependency on our locally
defined `hello` library so that we can access it.  The `test/dune`
file looks like this:

<!-- $MDX file=examples/correct/hello/test/dune -->
```scheme
(test
 (libraries hello)
 (name hello))
```

Once you run the tests via `dune runtest`, you can find the built
artifacts in `_build/default/test/` in your project checkout.

```sh skip
$ ls -la _build/default/test
total 992
drwxr-xr-x  7 avsm  staff     224 27 Feb 16:13 .
drwxr-xr-x  9 avsm  staff     288 27 Feb 15:23 ..
drwxr-xr-x  4 avsm  staff     128 27 Feb 15:23 .hello.eobjs
drwxr-xr-x  3 avsm  staff      96 27 Feb 16:12 .merlin-conf
-r-xr-xr-x  1 avsm  staff  495766 27 Feb 16:13 hello.exe
-r--r--r--  1 avsm  staff      64 27 Feb 16:13 hello.ml
-r--r--r--  1 avsm  staff      28 27 Feb 15:23 hello.mli
```

We deliberately defined two files called `hello.ml` in both
`lib/` and `test/`.  It's completely fine to define an executable
`hello.exe` (in `test/`) alongside the OCaml library called `hello`
(in `lib/`).

### Building an Executable Program

Finally, we want to actually use our hello world from the
command-line. This is defined in `bin/dune` in a very similar fashion
to test cases.

```scheme
(executable
 (public_name hello)
 (name main)
 (libraries hello)))
```

There has to be a `bin/main.ml` alongside the `bin/dune` file
that represents the entry module for the executable. Only that
module and the modules and libraries it depends on will be linked
into the executable. Much like libraries, the `(name)` field
here has to adhere to OCaml module naming conventions, and the
`public_name` field represents the binary name that is installed
onto the system and just needs to be a valid Unix or Windows filename.

Now try modifying `bin/main.ml` to refer to our  `Hello.Msg` module:

```
let () = print_endline Hello.Msg.greeting
```

You can build and execute the command locally using `dune exec` and
the local name of the executable.
You can also find the built executable in `_build/default/bin/main.exe`.


```sh dir=examples/correct/hello,skip
$ dune build
$ dune exec -- bin/main.exe
Hello World
```

You can also refer to the public name of the executable if it's more
convenient.

```sh dir=examples/correct/hello,skip
$ dune exec -- hello
Hello World
```

The `dune exec` and `opam exec` command we mentioned earlier in the chapter
both nest, so you could append them to each other using the double-dash
directive to separate them.

```
$ opam exec -- dune exec -- hello --args
```

This is quite a common thing to do when integrating with continuous integration
systems that need systematic scripting of both opam and dune (a topic we'll
come to shortly in this chapter).

## Setting Up an Integrated Development Environment

Now that we've seen the basic structure of the OCaml project, it's
time to setup an integrated development environment. An IDE is
particularly useful for OCaml because it lets you leverage the
information that's extracted by OCaml's rich type-system. A good IDE
will provide you with the facilities to browse interface
documentation, see inferred types for code, and to jump to the
definitions of external modules.

### Using Visual Studio Code

The recommended IDE for newcomers to OCaml is [Visual Studio
Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) using the [OCaml Platform
plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ocamllabs.ocaml-platform).
The plugin uses the Language Server Protocol to communicate with your
opam and dune environment. All you need to do is to install the OCaml
LSP server via opam:

```
opam install ocaml-lsp-server
```

Once installed, the VSCode OCaml plugin will ask you which opam switch
to use. Just the default one should be sufficient to get you going
with building and browsing your interfaces.

::: {data-type=note}
#### What Is The Language Server Protocol?

The Language Server Protocol defines a communications standard between
an editor or IDE and a language-specific server that provides features
such as auto-completion, definition search, reference indexing and other
facilities that require specialized support from language tooling.
This allows a programming language toolchain to implement all this
functionality just once, and then integrate cleanly into the multiplicity
of IDE environments available these days -- and even go beyond
conventional desktop environments to web-based notebooks such as Jupyter.

Since OCaml has a complete and mature LSP server, you'll find that
an increasing number of IDEs will just support it out of the box once
you install the ocaml-lsp-server.  It integrates automatically
with the various tools we've used in this book, such as detecting
opam switches, invoking dune rules, and so on.
:::


### Browsing Interface Documentation

The OCaml LSP server understands how to interface with dune and
examine the build artifacts (such as the typed `.cmt` interface files), so
opening your local project in VS Code is sufficient to activate all the
features.  Try navigating over to `bin/main.ml`, where you will see the
invocation to the `hello` library.

<!-- $MDX file=examples/correct/hello/bin/main.ml -->
```
let () = print_endline Hello.Msg.greeting
```

First perform a build of the project to generate the type annotation
files. Then hover your mouse over the `Hello.Msg.greeting` function -- you
should see some documentation pop up about the function and its
arguments.  This information comes from the _docstrings_ written into
the `msg.mli` interface file in the `hello` library.

Modify the `msg.mli` interface file to contain some signature documentation
as follows:

<!-- $MDX file=examples/correct/hello/lib/msg.mli -->
```
(** This is a docstring, as it starts with "**", as opposed to normal
    comments that start with a single star.

    The top-most docstring of the module should contain a description
    of the module, what it does, how to use it, etc.

    The function-specific documentation located below the function
    signatures. *)

(** This is the docstring for the [greeting] function.

    A typical documentation for this function would be:

    Returns a greeting message.

    {4 Examples}

    {[ print_endline greeting ]} *)
val greeting : string
```

Documentation strings are parsed by the
[odoc](https://github.com/ocaml/odoc) tool to generate HTML and PDF
documentation from a collection of opam packages.  If you intend your
code to be used by anyone else (or indeed, by yourself a few months
later) you should take the time to annotate your OCaml signature files
with documentation.  An easy way to preview the HTML documentation is
to build it locally with dune:

```skip
$ opam install odoc
$ dune build @doc
```

This will leave the HTML files in `_build/default/_doc/_html`, which
you can view normally with a web browser.

### Autoformatting Your Source Code

As you develop more OCaml code, you'll find it convenient to have it
formatted to a common style.  The `ocamlformat` tool can help you do
this easily from within VSCode.

```skip
$ echo 'version=0.20.1' > .ocamlformat
$ opam install ocamlformat.0.20.1
```

The `.ocamlformat` file controls the autoformatting options available,
and fixes the version of the tool that is used. You can upgrade to a
newer ocamlformat version whenever you want, but it is a manual
process to avoid an upstream release auto-reformatting your project
code without your intervention.  You can examine the formatting
options via `ocamlformat --help` -- most of the time the defaults
should be fine.

Once you've got ocamlformat configured, you can either format your
project from within VSCode (`shift-alt-F` being the default), or by
running:

```skip
$ dune build @fmt
```

This will generate a set of reformatted files in the build directory,
which you can accept with `dune promote` as you did earlier in the
testing chapter.

## Publishing Your Code Online

With your IDE all set up you'll quickly develop useful OCaml code and
want to share it with others.  We'll now go through how to define
opam packages, set up continuous integration and publish your code.

### Defining Opam Packages

The only metadata file that is really _required_ to participate in the
open-source OCaml ecosystem is an `opam` file in your source tree.  Each `opam`
file defines a *package* -- a collection of OCaml libraries and executable
binaries or application data.  Each opam package can define dependencies on
other opam packages, and includes build and testing directions for your
project.  This is what's installed when you eventually publish the package and
someone else types in `opam install hello`.

A collection of `opam` files can be stored in an *opam repository* to
create a package database, with a central one for the OCaml ecosystem
available at <https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository>.  The official
(but not exclusive) tool used for manipulating `opam` files is the
eponymous [opam package manager](https://opam.ocaml.org) that we've
been using throughout this book.

::: {data-type=note}
#### How Do We Name OCaml Modules, Libraries and Packages?

Much of the time, the module, library, and package names are all the
same.  But there are reasons for these names to be distinct as well:

- Some libraries are exposed as multiple top-level modules, which
  means you need a different name for that collection of modules.
- Even when the library has a single top-level module, you might want
  the library name to be different from the module name to avoid name
  clashes at the library level.
- Package names might differ from library names if a package combines
  multiple libraries and/or binaries together.

It's important to understand the difference between modules, libraries and
packages as you work on bigger projects. These can easily have thousands of
modules, hundreds of libraries and dozens of opam packages in a single
codebase.

:::

### Generating Project Metadata from Dune

The `hello.opam` file in our sample project is currently empty, but you don't
need to write it by hand -- instead, we can define our project metadata using
the dune build system and have the opam file autogenerated for us. The root
directory of an OCaml project built by dune has a `dune-project` file that
defines the project metadata. In our example project, it starts with:

```scheme
(lang dune 3.0)
```

The line above is the version of the syntax used in your build files,
and _not_ the actual version of the `dune` binary.  One of the nicest
features of dune is that it is forwards-compatible with older
metadata. By defining the version of the dune language that you are
currently using, _future_ versions of dune will do their best to
emulate the current behavior until you choose to upgrade your project.

The rest of the `dune-project` file defines other useful project metadata:

```scheme
(name hello)
(documentation "https://username.github.io/hello/")
(source (github username/hello))
(license ISC)
(authors "Your name")
(maintainers "Your name")
(generate_opam_files true)
```

The fields in here all represent project metadata ranging from textual
descriptions, to project URLs, to other opam package dependencies.
Go ahead and edit the metadata above to reflect your own details, and
then build the project:

```skip
$ dune build
```

The build command will update the `hello.opam` file in your source
tree as well, keeping it in sync with your changes.  The final part of
the `dune-project` file contains dependency information for other
packages your project depends on.

```scheme
(package
 (name hello)
 (synopsis "A short description of the project")
 (description "A short description of the project")
 (depends
  (ocaml (>= 4.08.0))
  (alcotest :with-test)
  (odoc :with-doc)))
```

The `(package)` stanza here refers to opam packages, both for the name
and for the dependency specifications.  This is in contrast to the
`dune` files which refer to ocamlfind libraries, since those represent
the compilation units for OCaml code (whereas opam packages are
broader collections of package data).

Notice that the dependency specification can also include version
information. One of the key features of opam is that each repository
contains multiple versions of the same package.  The opam CLI contains
a constraint solver that will find versions of all dependencies that
are compatible with your current project.  When you add a dependency,
you can therefore specify lower and upper version bounds as required
by your use of that package.  The `with-test` and `with-doc` are
further constraints that only add those dependencies for test and
documentation generation respectively.

Once you've defined your opam and dune dependencies, you can run
various lint commands to check that your metadata is consistent.

```skip
$ opam dune-lint
$ opam lint
```

The `opam-dune-lint` plugin will check that the ocamlfind libraries
and opam packages in your dune files match up, and offer to fix them
up if it spots a mismatch. `opam lint` runs additional checks on the
opam files within your project.


### Setting up Continuous Integration

Once you have your project metadata defined, it's a good time to begin
hosting it online.  Two of the most popular platforms for this are
[GitHub](https://github.com) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com).  The
remainder of this chapter will assume you are using GitHub for
simplicity, although you are encouraged to check out the alternatives
to find the best solution for your own needs.

When you create a GitHub repository and push your code to it, you can
also add an OCaml GitHub Action that will install the OCaml Platform
tools and run your code across various architectures and operating
systems.  You can find the full documentation online at the [Set up
OCaml](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/set-up-ocaml) page on
the GitHub marketplace.  Configuring an action is as simple as adding
a `.github/workflows/test.yml` file to your project that looks
something like this:

```yaml
name: Hello world workflow
on:
  pull_request:
  push:
jobs:
  build:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os:
          - macos-latest
          - ubuntu-latest
          - windows-latest
        ocaml-compiler:
          - 4.14.x
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Use OCaml ${{ matrix.ocaml-compiler }}
        uses: ocaml/setup-ocaml@v2
        with:
          ocaml-compiler: ${{ matrix.ocaml-compiler }}
      - run: opam install . --deps-only --with-test
      - run: opam exec -- dune build
      - run: opam exec -- dune runtest
```

This workflow file will run your project on OCaml installations on
Windows, macOS and Linux, using the latest patch release of OCaml
4.14.  Notice that it also runs the test cases you have defined
earlier on all those different operating systems as well.  You can do
an awful lot of customization of these continuous integration
workflows, so refer to the online documentation for more options.

### Other Conventions

There are a few other files you may also want to add to a project
to match common conventions:

- A `Makefile` contains targets for common actions such as `all`,
  `build`, `test` or `clean`. While you don't need this when using
  VSCode, some other operating system package managers might benefit
  from having one present.
- The `LICENSE` defines the terms under which your code is made
  available. Our example defaults to the permissive ISC license, and
  this is generally a safe default unless you have specific plans
  for your project.
- A `README.md` is a Markdown-formatted introduction to your library
  or application.
- A `.gitignore` file contains the patterns for generated files from
  the OCaml tools so that they can be ignored by the Git version
  control software.  If you're not familiar with using Git, look over
  one of the tutorials one such as GitHub's [git hello
  world](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).

### Releasing Your Code into the Opam Repository

Once your continuous integration is passing, you are all set to try to
tag a release of your project and share it with other users!  The
OCaml Platform supplies a convenient tool called `dune-release` which
automates much of this process for you.

```skip
$ opam install dune-release
```

The first thing you need to do is to create a `CHANGES.md` file in
your project in Markdown format, which contains a header per version.
This is typically a succinct summary of the changes between versions
that can be read by users.  For our first release, we might have:

```
## v1.0.0

- Initial public release of our glorious hello world
  project (@avsm)
- Added test cases for making sure we do in fact hello world.
```

Commit this file to your repository in the root. Before you proceed
with a release, you need to make sure that all of your local changes
have been pushed to the remote GitHub repository, and that your
working tree is clean.  You can do this by using git:

```
$ git clean -dxf
$ git diff
```

This will remove any untracked files from the local checkout (such as
the `_build` directory) and check that tracked files are unmodified.
We should now be ready to perform the release!  First create a git tag
to mark this release:

```skip
$ dune-release tag
```

This will parse your `CHANGES.md` file and figure out the latest
version, and create a local git tag in your repository after prompting
you. Once that succeeds, you can start the release process via:

```skip
$ dune-release
```

This will begin an interactive session where you will need to enter
some GitHub authentication details (via creating a personal access
token).  Once that is completed, the tool will run all local tests,
generate documentation and upload it to your GitHub pages branch for
that project, and finally offer to open a pull request to the central
opam-repository.  Recall that the central opam package set is all just
a normal git repository, and so your opam file will be added to that
and your GitHub account will create a PR.

At this point, you can sit back and relax while the central opam
repository test system runs your package through a battery of
installations (including on exotic architectures you might not access
to, such as S390X mainframes or 32-bit ARMv7).  If there is a problem
detected, some friendly maintainers from the OCaml community will
comment on the pull request and guide you through how to address it.
You can simply delete the git tag and re-run the release process until
the package is merged.  Once it is merged, you can navigate to the
<ocaml.org> site and view it online in an hour or so.  It will also be
available in the central repository for other users to install.

#### Creating Lock Files for Your Projects

Before you publish a project, you might also want to create an
opam lock file to include with the archive. A lock file records
the exact versions of all the transitive opam dependencies at
the time you generate it.  All you need to do is to run:

```sh skip
$ opam lock
```

This generates a `pkgname.opam.locked` file which contains
the same metadata as your original file, but with all the dependencies
explicitly listed.  Later on, if a user wants to reconstruct your exact opam
environment (as opposed to the package solution they might calculate with a
future opam repository), then they can pass an option during installation:

```sh skip
$ opam install pkgname --locked
$ opam switch create . --locked
```

Lock files are an optional but useful step to take when releasing your
project to the Internet.

## Learning More from Real Projects

There's a lot more customization that happens in any real project, and
we can't cover every aspect in this book. The best way by far to learn
more is to dive in and compile an already established project, and
perhaps even contribute to it. There are thousands of libraries and
executable projects released on the opam repository which you can find
online at <https://ocaml.org>.

A selection of some include:

- `patdiff` is an OCaml implementation of the patience diff algorithm,
  and is a nice self-contained CLI project using Core. <https://github.com/janestreet/patdiff>
- The source code to this book is published as a self-contained monorepo
  with all the dependencies bundled together, for convenient compilation.
  <https://github.com/realworldocaml/book>
- Flow is a static typechecker for JavaScript written in OCaml that uses
  Base and works on macOS, Windows and Linux.  It's a good example of a large,
  cross-platform CLI-driven tool. <https://github.com/facebook/flow>
- Octez is an OCaml implementation of a proof-of-stake blockchain
  called Tezos, which contains a [comprehensive
  collection](https://tezos.gitlab.io/shell/the_big_picture.html#packages)
  of libraries such as interpreters for a stack language, and a shell
  that uses Lwt to provide networking, storage and cryptographic
  communications to the outside
  world. <https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos>
- MirageOS is a library operating system written in OCaml, that can compile code to a
  variety of embedded and hypervisor targets. There are 100s of libraries all written
  using dune in a variety of ways available at <https://github.com/mirage>.
- You can find a number of standalone OCaml libraries for unicode, parsing and computer
  graphics and OS interaction over at <https://erratique.ch/software>.
