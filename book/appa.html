    <h1>Installation</h1>

    <p>To work through <em>Real World OCaml</em>, you'll need the
    following software packages installed:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><a href="http://ocaml.org">OCaml</a> version 4.1.0 or
        greater. This book uses some tools that we've developed
        while writing it, and so you need to ensure that you have
        at least this version before trying the examples in the
        book.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><a href="http://opam.ocaml.org">OPAM</a> version 1.0 or
        greater. This will give you access to all the OCaml
        libraries used in <em>Real World OCaml</em>.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/diml/utop"><em>utop</em></a>
        is a modern interactive toplevel with command history, tab
        completion, and defaults that are tuned to work with the
        examples in <em>Real World OCaml</em>.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The easiest way to install OCaml is usually via the binary
    packages available for many operating systems. For day-to-day
    code development, however, it's much easier to use a
    source-code manager that lets you modify individual libraries
    and automatically recompile all the dependencies.

    instructions</idx></p>

    <p>An important difference between OCaml and scripting
    languages such as Python or Ruby is the static type safety that
    means that you can't just mix and match compiled libraries.
    Interfaces are checked when libraries are compiled, so when an
    interface is changed, all the dependent libraries must also be
    recompiled. Source-based package managers such as OPAM automate
    this process for you and make development life much easier.</p>

          contains the HTML documentation for all the libraries
          used within the book. This is a convenient reference for
          the Core interfaces, and also the other third-party
          software we use, such as Yojson or Menhir.</p>
