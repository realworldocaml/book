      <p>
	Programming with objects directly is great for encapsulation,
	but one of the main goals of object-oriented programming is
	code reuse through inheritance. For inheritance, we need to
	introduce <em>classes</em>. In object-oriented programming, a
	class is a "recipe" for creating objects. The recipe can be
	changed by adding new methods and fields, or it can be changed
	by modifying existing methods.

	<h1>OCaml Classes</h1>

	<p>
	  In OCaml, class definitions must be defined as toplevel
	  statements in a module. The syntax for a class definition
	  uses the keyword <code>class</code>:

	  <idx>classes/basic syntax for</idx></p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/classes/istack.mlt" part="1"/>

	<p>
	  The <code>class istack : object ... end</code> result shows
	  that we have created a class <code>istack</code>
	  with <em>class type</em> <code>object ... end</code>. Like
	  module types, class types are completely separate from
	  regular OCaml types
	  (e.g., <code>int</code>, <code>string</code>,
	  and <code>list</code>) and, in particular, should not be
	  confused with object types (e.g., <code>&lt; get : int; ..
	    &gt;</code>). The class type describes the class itself
	  rather than the objects that the class creates. This
	  particular class type specifies that the <code>istack</code>
	  class defines a mutable field <code>v</code>, a method
	  <code>pop</code> that returns an <span><code>int
	      option</code></span>, and a method <code>push</code> with
	  type <code>int -&gt; unit</code>.</p>

	<p>
	  To produce an object, classes are instantiated with the
	  keyword <code>new</code>:</p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/classes/istack.mlt" part="2"/>

	<p>
	  You may have noticed that the object <code>s</code> has
	  been given the type <code>istack</code>. But wait, we've
	  stressed <em>classes are not types</em>, so what's up with
	  that? In fact, what we've said is entirely true: classes and
	  class names <em>are not</em> types. However, for convenience,
	  the definition of the class <code>istack</code> also defines
	  an object type <code>istack</code> with the same methods as
	  the class. This type definition is equivalent to:</p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/classes/istack.mlt" part="3"/>

	<p>
	  Note that this type represents any object with these
	  methods: objects created using the <code>istack</code> class
	  will have this type, but objects with this type may not have
	  been created by the <code>istack</code> class.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="class-parameters-and-polymorphism" data-type="sect1">
	<h1>Class Parameters and Polymorphism</h1>

	<p>
	  A class definition serves as the <em>constructor</em> for
	  the class. In general, a class definition may have parameters
	  that must be provided as arguments when the object is created
	  with <code>new</code>.

	  <idx>polymorphism/class parameters and</idx>
	  <idx>classes/class parameters and polymorphism</idx></p>

	<p>
	  Let's implement a variant of the <code>istack</code> class
	  that can hold any values, not just integers. When defining
	  the class, the type parameters are placed in square brackets
	  before the class name in the class definition. We also add a
	  parameter <code>init</code> for the initial contents of the
	  stack:</p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/classes/stack.mlt" part="0.5"/>

	<p>
	  Note that the type parameter <code>['a]</code> in the
	  definition uses square brackets, but for other uses of the
	  type they are omitted (or replaced with parentheses if there
	  is more than one type parameter).</p>

	<p>
	  The type annotation on the declaration of <code>v</code>
	  is used to constrain type inference. If we omit this
	  annotation, the type inferred for the class will be "too
	  polymorphic": <code>init</code> could have some type <code>'b
	    list</code>:</p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/classes/stack.mlt" part="1"/>

	<p>
	  In general, we need to provide enough constraints so that
	  the compiler will infer the correct type. We can add type
	  constraints to the parameters, to the fields, and to the
	  methods. It is a matter of preference how many constraints to
	  add. You can add type constraints in all three places, but
	  the extra text may not help clarity. A convenient middle
	  ground is to annotate the fields and/or class parameters, and
	  add constraints to methods only if necessary.</p>

      <section id="object-types-as-interfaces" data-type="sect1">
	<h1>Object Types as Interfaces</h1>

	<p>
	  We may wish to traverse the elements on our stack. One
	  common style for doing this in object-oriented languages is
	  to define a class for an <code>iterator</code> object. An
	  iterator provides a generic mechanism to inspect and traverse
	  the elements of a collection.

	  <idx>elements/traversing with iterator objects</idx>
	  <idx>iterators</idx>
	  <idx>objects/object types as interfaces</idx>
	  <idx>interfaces/object types as</idx>
	  <idx>classes/object types as interfaces</idx></p>

	<p>
	  There are two common styles for defining abstract
	  interfaces like this. In Java, an iterator would normally be
	  specified with an interface, which specifies a set of method
	  types:</p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/classes/Iterator.java"/>

	<p>
	  In languages without interfaces, like C++, the
	  specification would normally use <em>abstract</em> classes to
	  specify the methods without implementing them (C++ uses the
	  "= 0" definition to mean "not implemented"):</p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/classes/citerator.cpp"/>

	<p>
	  OCaml supports both styles. In fact, OCaml is more
	  flexible than these approaches because an object type can be
	  implemented by any object with the appropriate methods; it
	  does not have to be specified by the object's class <em>a
	    priori</em>. We'll leave abstract classes for later. Let's
	  demonstrate the technique using object types.</p>

	<p>
	  First, we'll define an object type <code>iterator</code>
	  that specifies the methods in an iterator:</p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/classes/iter.mlt" part="0.5"/>

	<p>
	  Next, we'll define an actual iterator for lists. We can
	  use this to iterate over the contents of our stack:</p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/classes/iter.mlt" part="1"/>

	<p>
	  Finally, we add a method <code>iterator</code> to the
	  <code>stack</code> class to produce an iterator. To do so, we
	  construct a <code>list_iterator</code> that refers to the
	  current contents of the stack:</p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/classes/iter.mlt" part="2"/>

	<p>
	  Now we can build a new stack, push some values to it, and
	  iterate over them:</p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/classes/iter.mlt" part="3"/>

	<section id="functional-iterators" data-type="sect2">
          <h2>Functional Iterators</h2>

          <p>
	    In practice, most OCaml programmers avoid iterator
            objects in favor of functional-style techniques. For
            example, the alternative <code>stack</code> class that
            follows takes a function <code>f</code> and applies it to
            each of the elements on the stack:

	    <idx>functional iterators</idx></p>

          <link rel="import" href="code/classes/iter.mlt" part="4"/>

          <p>
	    What about functional operations like <code>map</code>
            and <code>fold</code>? In general, these methods take a
            function that produces a value of some other type than the
            elements of the set.</p>

          <p>
	    For example, a <code>fold</code> method for our
            <code>['a] stack</code> class should have type <code>('b
              -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; 'b -&gt; 'b</code>, where the
            <code>'b</code> is polymorphic. To express a polymorphic
            method type like this, we must use a type quantifier, as
            shown in the following example:</p>

          <link rel="import" href="code/classes/iter.mlt" part="5"/>

          <p>
	    The type quantifier <code>'b.</code> can be read as "for
            all <code>'b</code>.” Type quantifiers can only be used
            <em>directly after</em> the method name, which means that
            method parameters must be expressed using a
            <code>fun</code> or <code>function</code> expression.</p>
	</section>
      </section>

      <section id="inheritance" data-type="sect1">
	<h1>Inheritance</h1>

	<p>
	  Inheritance uses an existing class to define a new one.
	  For example, the following class definition inherits from our
	  <code>stack</code> class for strings and adds a new method
	  <code>print</code> that prints all the strings on the
	  stack:

	  <idx>inheritance</idx>
	  <idx>classes/inheritance in</idx></p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/classes/stack.mlt" part="2"/>

	<p>
	  A class can override methods from classes it inherits. For
	  example, this class creates stacks of integers that double
	  the integers before they are pushed onto the stack:</p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/classes/stack.mlt" part="3"/>

	<p>
	  The preceding <code>as super</code> statement creates a
	  special object called <code>super</code> which can be used to
	  call superclass methods. Note that <code>super</code> is not
	  a real object and can only be used to call methods.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="class-types" data-type="sect1">
	<h1>Class Types</h1>

	<p>
	  To allow code in a different file or module to inherit
	  from a class, we must expose it and give it a class type.
	  What is the class type?

	  <idx>classes/class types</idx></p>

	<p>
	  As an example, let's wrap up our <code>stack</code> class
	  in an explicit module (we'll use explicit modules for
	  illustration, but the process is similar when we want to
	  define a <code>.mli</code> file). In keeping with the usual
	  style for modules, we define a type <code>'a t</code> to
	  represent the type of our stacks:</p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/classes/class_types_stack.ml"/>

	<p>
	  We have multiple choices in defining the module type,
	  depending on how much of the implementation we want to
	  expose. At one extreme, a maximally abstract signature would
	  completely hide the class definitions:</p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/classes/class_types_stack.ml" part="1"/>

	<p>
	  The abstract signature is simple because we ignore the
	  classes. But what if we want to include them in the signature
	  so that other modules can inherit from the class definitions?
	  For this, we need to specify types for the classes, called
	  <em>class types</em>.</p>

	<p>
	  Class types do not appear in mainstream object-oriented
	  programming languages, so you may not be familiar with them,
	  but the concept is pretty simple. A class type specifies the
	  type of each of the visible parts of the class, including
	  both fields and methods. Just as with module types, you don't
	  have to give a type for everything; anything you omit will be
	  hidden:</p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/classes/class_types_stack.ml" part="2"/>

	<p>
	  In this signature, we've chosen to make everything
	  visible. The class type for <code>stack</code> specifies the
	  types of the field <code>v</code>, as well as the types of
	  each of the methods.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="open-recursion" data-type="sect1">
	<h1>Open Recursion</h1>

	<p>
	  Open recursion allows an object's methods to invoke other
	  methods on the same object. These calls are looked up
	  dynamically, allowing a method in one class to call a method
	  from another class, if both classes are inherited by the same
	  object. This allows mutually recursive parts of an object to
	  be defined separately.

	  <idx>recursion/open recursion</idx>
	  <idx>open recursion</idx>
	  <idx>classes/open recursion in</idx></p>

	<p>
	  This ability to define mutually recursive methods from
	  separate components is a key feature of classes: achieving
	  similar functionality with data types or modules is much more
	  cumbersome and verbose.</p>

	<p>
	  For example, consider writing recursive functions over a
	  simple document format. This format is represented as a tree
	  with three different types of node:</p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/classes/doc.ml"/>

	<p>
	  It is quite easy to write a function that operates by
	  recursively traversing this data. However, what if you need
	  to write many similar recursive functions? How can you factor
	  out the common parts of these functions to avoid repetitive
	  boilerplate?</p>

	<p>
	  The simplest way is to use classes and open recursion. For
	  example, the following class defines objects that fold over
	  the document data:</p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/classes/doc.ml" part="1"/>

	<p>
	  The <code>object (self)</code> syntax binds
	  <code>self</code> to the current object, allowing the
	  <code>doc</code>, <code>list_item</code>, and
	  <code>text_item</code> methods to call each other.</p>

	<p>
	  By inheriting from this class, we can create functions
	  that fold over the document data. For example, the
	  <code>count_doc</code> function counts the number of bold
	  tags in the document that are not within a list:</p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/classes/doc.ml" part="2"/>

	<p>
	  Note how the <code>super</code> special object is used in
	  <code>text_item</code> to call the <code>[int] folder</code>
	  class's <code>text_item</code> method to fold over the
	  children of the <code>text_item</code> node.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="private-methods" data-type="sect1">
	<h1>Private Methods</h1>

	<p>
	  Methods can be declared <em>private</em>, which means that
	  they may be called by subclasses, but they are not visible
	  otherwise (similar to a <em>protected</em> method in
	  C++).

	  <idx>methods/private methods</idx>
	  <idx>protected methods</idx>
	  <idx>private methods</idx>
	  <idx>classes/private methods for</idx></p>

	<p>
	  For example, we may want to include methods in our
	  <code>folder</code> class for handling each of the different
	  cases in <code>doc</code> and <code>text_item</code>.
	  However, we may not want to force subclasses of
	  <code>folder</code> to expose these methods, as they probably
	  shouldn't be called directly:</p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/classes/doc.ml" part="3"/>

	<p>
	  The final statement that builds the value <code>f</code>
	  shows how the instantiation of a <code>folder2</code> object
	  has a type that hides the private methods.</p>

	<p>
	  To be precise, the private methods are part of the class
	  type, but not part of the object type. This means, for
	  example, that the object <code>f</code> has no method
	  <code>bold</code>. However, the private methods are available
	  to subclasses: we can use them to simplify our
	  <code>counter</code> class:</p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/classes/doc.ml" part="4"/>

	<p>
	  The key property of private methods is that they are
	  visible to subclasses, but not anywhere else. If you want the
	  stronger guarantee that a method is <em>really</em> private,
	  not even accessible in subclasses, you can use an explicit
	  class type that omits the method. In the following code, the
	  private methods are explicitly omitted from the class type of
	  <code>counter_with_sig</code> and can't be invoked in
	  subclasses of <code>counter_with_sig</code>:</p>

      </section>

      <section id="binary-methods" data-type="sect1">
	<h1>Binary Methods</h1>

	<p>
	  A <em>binary method</em> is a method that takes an object
	  of <code>self</code> type. One common example is defining a
	  method for equality:

	  <idx>methods/binary methods</idx>
	  <idx>classes/binary methods for</idx>
	  <idx>binary methods</idx></p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/classes/binary.mlt" part="0.5"/>

	<p>
	  Note how we can use the type annotation <code>(self:
	    'self)</code> to obtain the type of the current object.</p>

	<p>
	  We can now test different object instances for equality by
	  using the <code>equals</code> binary method:</p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/classes/binary.mlt" part="1"/>

	<p>
	  This works, but there is a problem lurking here. The
	  method <code>equals</code> takes an object of the exact type
	  <code>square</code> or <code>circle</code>. Because of this,
	  we can't define a common base class <code>shape</code> that
	  also includes an equality method:</p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/classes/binary.mlt" part="2"/>

	<p>
	  The problem is that a <code>square</code> expects to be
	  compared with a <code>square</code>, not an arbitrary shape;
	  likewise for <code>circle</code>. This problem is
	  fundamental. Many languages solve it either with narrowing
	  (with dynamic type checking), or by method overloading. Since
	  OCaml has neither of these, what can we do?

	  <idx>methods/method overloading</idx>
	  <idx>dynamic type checking</idx>
	  <idx>narrowing</idx>
	  <idx>polymorphism/polymorphic equality</idx></p>

	<p>
	  Since the problematic method is equality, one proposal we
	  could consider is to just drop it from the base type
	  <code>shape</code> and use polymorphic equality instead.
	  However, the built-in polymorphic equality has very poor
	  behavior when applied to objects:</p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/classes/binary.mlt" part="3"/>

	<p>
	  The problem here is that two objects are considered equal
	  by the built-in polymorphic equality if and only if they are
	  physically equal. There are other reasons not to use the
	  built-in polymorphic equality, but these false negatives are
	  a showstopper.</p>

	<p>
	  If we want to define equality for shapes in general, the
	  remaining solution is to use the same approach as we
	  described for narrowing. That is, introduce a
	  <em>representation</em> type implemented using variants, and
	  implement the comparison based on the representation
	  type:

	  <idx>representation types</idx></p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/classes/binary.mlt" part="4"/>

	<p>
	  The binary method <code>equals</code> is now implemented
	  in terms of the concrete type <code>shape_repr</code>. When
	  using this pattern, you will not be able to hide the
	  <code>repr</code> method, but you can hide the type
	  definition using the module system:</p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/classes/binary_module.ml"/>

	<p>
	  Note that this solution prevents us from adding new kinds
	  of shapes without adding new constructors to the
	  <code>shape_repr</code> type, which is quite restrictive. The
	  objects created by these classes are also in one-to-one
	  correspondence with members of the representation type,
	  making the objects seem somewhat redundant.</p>

	<p>
	  However, equality is quite an extreme instance of a binary
	  method: it needs access to all the information of the other
	  object. Many other binary methods need only partial
	  information about the object. For instance, a method that
	  compares shapes by their sizes:</p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/classes/binary_larger.ml"/>

	<p>
	  In this case, there is no one-to-one correspondence
	  between the objects and their sizes, and we can still easily
	  define new kinds of shape.</p>

      <section id="virtual-classes-and-methods" data-type="sect1">
	<h1>Virtual Classes and Methods</h1>

	<p>
	  A <em>virtual</em> class is a class where some methods or
	  fields are declared but not implemented. This should not be
	  confused with the word <code>virtual</code> as it is used in
	  C++. A <code>virtual</code> method in C++ uses dynamic
	  dispatch, while regular, nonvirtual methods are statically
	  dispatched. In OCaml, <em>all</em> methods use dynamic
	  dispatch, but the keyword <code>virtual</code> means that the
	  method or field is not implemented. A class containing
	  virtual methods must also be flagged <code>virtual</code> and
	  cannot be directly instantiated (i.e., no object of this
	  class can be created).

	<p>
	  To explore this, let's extend our shapes examples to
	  simple, interactive graphics. We will use the Async
	  concurrency library and the <a href="http://github.com/lpw25/async_graphics/">Async_graphics</a>
	  library, which provides an asynchronous interface to OCaml's
	  built-in Graphics library. Concurrent programming with Async
	  will be explored later in <a href="18-concurrent-programming.html#concurrent-programming-with-async" data-type="xref">Concurrent Programming With Async</a>; for
	  now you can safely ignore the details. You just need to run
	  <code>opam install async_graphics</code> to get the library
	  installed on your system.</p>

	<p>
	  We will give each shape a <code>draw</code> method that
	  describes how to draw the shape on the
	  <code>Async_graphics</code> display:</p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/classes-async/shapes/shapes.ml"/>

	<section id="create-some-simple-shapes" data-type="sect2">
          <h2>Create Some Simple Shapes</h2>

          <p>
	    Now let's add classes for making squares and circles. We
            include an <code>on_click</code> method for adding event
            handlers to the shapes:

	    <idx>geometric shapes</idx></p>

          <link rel="import" href="code/classes-async/verbose_shapes.ml" part="1"/>

          <p>
	    The <code>square</code> class is pretty straightforward,
            and the <code>circle</code> class below also looks very
            similar:</p>

          <link rel="import" href="code/classes-async/verbose_shapes.ml" part="2"/>

          <p>
	    These classes have a lot in common, and it would be
            useful to factor out this common functionality into a
            superclass. We can easily move the definitions of
            <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> into a superclass, but
            what about <code>on_click</code>? Its definition depends on
            <code>contains</code>, which has a different definition in
            each class. The solution is to create a <em>virtual</em>
            class. This class will declare a <code>contains</code>
            method but leave its definition to the subclasses.</p>

          <p>
	    Here is the more succinct definition, starting with a
            virtual <code>shape</code> class that implements
            <code>on_click</code> and <code>on_mousedown</code>:</p>

          <link rel="import" href="code/classes-async/shapes/shapes.ml" part="1"/>

          <p>
	    Now we can define <code>square</code> and
            <code>circle</code> by inheriting from
            <code>shape</code>:</p>

          <link rel="import" href="code/classes-async/shapes/shapes.ml" part="2"/>

          <p>
	    One way to view a <code>virtual</code> class is that it
            is like a functor, where the "inputs" are the declared—but
            not defined—virtual methods and fields. The functor
            application is implemented through inheritance, when
            virtual methods are given concrete implementations.</p>

	  initial value of a field:

	  <idx>initializers</idx>
	  <idx>classes/initializers for</idx></p>

	<link rel="import" href="code/classes/initializer.mlt" part="1"/>

	<p>
	  However, these expressions are executed before the object
	  has been created and cannot refer to the methods of the
	  object. If you need to use an object's methods during
	  instantiation, you can use an initializer. An initializer is
	  an expression that will be executed during instantiation but
	  after the object has been created.</p>

	  For example, suppose we wanted to extend our previous
	  shapes module with a <code>growing_circle</code> class for
	  circles that expand when clicked. We could inherit from
	  <code>circle</code> and used the inherited
	  <code>on_click</code> to add a handler for click events:</p>

	<h1>Multiple Inheritance</h1>

	<p>
	  When a class inherits from more than one superclass, it is
	  using <em>multiple inheritance</em>. Multiple inheritance
	  extends the variety of ways that classes can be combined, and
	  it can be quite useful, particularly with virtual classes.
	  However, it can be tricky to use, particularly when the
	  inheritance hierarchy is a graph rather than a tree, so it
	  should be used with care.

	<section id="how-names-are-resolved" data-type="sect2">
          <h2>How Names Are Resolved</h2>

          <p>
	    The main trickiness of multiple inheritance is due to
            naming—what happens when a method or field with some name
            is defined in more than one class?</p>

          <p>
	    If there is one thing to remember about inheritance in
            OCaml, it is this: inheritance is like textual inclusion.
            If there is more than one definition for a name, the last
            definition wins.</p>

          <p>
	    For example, consider this class, which inherits from
            <code>square</code> and defines a new <code>draw</code>
            method that uses <code>draw_rect</code> instead of
            <code>fill_rect</code> to draw the square:</p>

          <link rel="import" href="code/classes-async/multiple_inheritance.ml" part="1"/>

          <p>
	    Since the <code>inherit</code> declaration comes before
            the method definition, the new <code>draw</code> method
            overrides the old one, and the square is drawn using
            <code>draw_rect</code>. But, what if we had defined
            <code>square_outline</code> as follows?</p>

          <link rel="import" href="code/classes-async/multiple_inheritance_wrong.ml" part="1"/>

          <p>
	    Here the <code>inherit</code> declaration comes after
            the method definition, so the <code>draw</code> method from
            <code>square</code> will override the other definition, and
            the square will be drawn using <code>fill_rect</code>.</p>

          <p>
	    To reiterate, to understand what inheritance means,
            replace each <code>inherit</code> directive with its
            definition, and take the last definition of each method or
            field. Note that the methods and fields added by an
            inheritance are those listed in its class type, so private
            methods that are hidden by the type will not be
            included.</p>

	    When should you use multiple inheritance? If you ask
            multiple people, you're likely to get multiple (perhaps
            heated) answers. Some will argue that multiple inheritance
            is overly complicated; others will argue that inheritance
            is problematic in general, and one should use object
            composition instead. But regardless of who you talk to, you
            will rarely hear that multiple inheritance is great and
            that you should use it widely.

	    <idx>mixin patterns</idx>
	    <idx>multiple inheritance/mixin pattern and</idx></p>

          <p>
	    In any case, if you're programming with objects, there's
            one general pattern for multiple inheritance that is both
            useful and reasonably simple: the <em>mixin</em> pattern.
            Generically, a <em>mixin</em> is just a virtual class that
            implements a feature based on another one. If you have a
            class that implements methods <em>A</em>, and you have a
            mixin <em>M</em> that provides methods <em>B</em> from
            <em>A</em>, then you can inherit from <em>M</em>—"mixing"
            it in—to get features <em>B</em>.</p>

          <p>
	    That's too abstract, so let's give some examples based
            on our interactive shapes. We may wish to allow a shape to
            be dragged by the mouse. We can define this functionality
            for any object that has mutable <code>x</code> and
            <code>y</code> fields and an <code>on_mousedown</code>
            method for adding event handlers:</p>

          <link rel="import" href="code/classes-async/shapes/shapes.ml" part="4"/>

          <p>
	    This allows us to create draggable shapes using multiple
            inheritance:</p>

          <link rel="import" href="code/classes-async/shapes/shapes.ml" part="5"/>

          <p>
	    We can also use mixins to create animated shapes. Each
            animated shape has a list of update functions to be called
            during animation. We create an <code>animated</code> mixin
            to provide this update list and ensure that the functions
            in it are called regular intervals when the shape is
            animated:

	    <idx>animation/creating with mixins</idx></p>

          <link rel="import" href="code/classes-async/shapes/shapes.ml" part="6"/>

          <p>
	    We use initializers to add functions to this update
            list. For example, this class will produce circles that
            move to the right for a second when clicked:</p>

          <link rel="import" href="code/classes-async/shapes/shapes.ml" part="7"/>

          <p>
	    These initializers can also be added using mixins:</p>

          <link rel="import" href="code/classes-async/shapes/shapes.ml" part="8"/>

          <p>
	    Since the <code>linear</code> and <code>harmonic</code>
            mixins are only used for their side effects, they can be
            inherited multiple times within the same object to produce
            a variety of different animations:

	    <idx>linear mixins</idx></p>

	<section id="displaying-the-animated-shapes" data-type="sect2">
          <h2>Displaying the Animated Shapes</h2>

          <p>
	    We finish our shapes module by creating a
            <code>main</code> function to draw some shapes on the
            graphical display and running that function using the Async
            scheduler:

	    <idx>animation/displaying animated shapes</idx>
	    <idx>multiple inheritance/displaying animated shapes with</idx></p>

          <link rel="import" href="code/classes-async/shapes/shapes.ml" part="10"/>

          <p>
	    Our <code>main</code> function creates a list of shapes
            to be displayed and defines a <code>repaint</code> function
            that actually draws them on the display. We then open a
            graphical display and ask Async to run <code>repaint</code>
            at regular intervals.</p>

          <p>
	    Finally, build the binary by linking against the
            <code>async_graphics</code> package, which will pull in all
            the other dependencies:</p>
          <link rel="import" href="code/classes-async/shapes/jbuild"/>
          <link rel="import" href="code/classes-async/shapes/build_shapes.sh"/>

          <p>
	    When you run the binary, a new graphical window should
            appear (on Mac OS X, you will need to install the X11
            package first, which you will be prompted for). Try
            clicking on the various widgets, and gasp in awe at the
            sophisticated animations that unfold as a result.</p>

          <p>
	    The graphics library described here is the one built
            into OCaml and is more useful as a learning tool than
            anything else. There are several third-party libraries that
            provide more sophisticated bindings to various graphics
            subsystems:
