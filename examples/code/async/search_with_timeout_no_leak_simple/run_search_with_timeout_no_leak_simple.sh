  concurrent programming
  ----------------------

  "Concurrent computing is a form of computing in which several
  computations are executed during overlapping time
  periods—concurrently—instead of sequentially. This is a property
  of a system—this may be an individual program, a computer, or a
  network—and there is a separate execution point or \"thread of
  control\" for each computation. A concurrent system is one where a
  computation can advance without waiting for all other computations to
  complete."

  ocaml
  -----

  "OCaml, originally named Objective Caml, is the main implementation of
  the programming language Caml, created by Xavier Leroy, Jérôme
  Vouillon, Damien Doligez, Didier Rémy, Ascánder Suárez and others
  in 1996. A member of the ML language family, OCaml extends the core
  Caml language with object-oriented programming constructs."
