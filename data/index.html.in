                <h1>FAQ</h1>
                
                <P><b>Why do I need to provide my Github login details to add comments?</b></p>

                <p>You need a
                   free <a href="http://github.com/">Github</a>
                   account to make comments on the book.  You will be
                   redirected to Github to login to authenticate to
                   the website.  When this is complete,
                   you <i>temporarily</i> grant us access to your
                   public repositories.  However, we do not store your
                   authorization tokens on the server side and instead
                   use a client-side cookie on your browser.  To log
                   out, simply delete the cookie.</p>

                <p>Once authenticated, every paragraph in the book
                   will now have a <tt>(comments)</tt> link just
                   beside it.  Clicking on this link will show you all
                   the comments that other reviewers have made.  You
                   can enter your own feedback in there, which will
                   result in an issue being created on
                   the <a href="http://github.com/realworldocaml/rwo-comments/issues">RWO
                   comments repository</a>.  This issue will be
                   created using your own Github account, and makes it
                   easier for Anil, Yaron and Jason to follow up with
                   questions.</p>
                <p>You will receive e-mail notifications from Github
                   whenever the issue is updated (either with a
                   followup, or just a notification that we've fixed
                   your problem in the next revision of the book).</p>

                <p><b>Do I create a new issue if I want to comment on
                someone else's comment?</b></p>
                <p>No.  If you are browsing comments and you want to
                   start a thread on someone else's comment, then just
                   follow the link marked <tt>(github)</tt> right
                   beside that particular comment.  This will take you
                   directly to the Github issue tracker where you can
                   lodge your feedback.

                <p><b>Why do I need to grant you so much access to the rest of my Github?</b></p>
                <p>Sadly, the Github oAuth mechanism is severely
                limited in how much access control that we can
                request.  We just want the ability to create issues in
                one
                specific <a href="http://github.com/ocamllabs/rwo-comments">public
                repository</a>, but the minimum privileges we can
                request from Github are the ones you see when you
                login.  If you can convince someone at Github to add
                more granular permissions, let us know!  However,
                we <i>never</i> store your authorization tokens in our
                server, and instead just directly pass your
                authorization token into a client-side cookie.</p>

                <p><b>Who is Bactrian the Double Humped OCaml, and why
                does this mysterious ungulate comment on every
                issue?</b></p>
                <p>We use Github to store all the comments recorded
                   against book milestones instead of keeping our own
                   database.  To render the HTML pages, we need to map
                   back every Github issue into a concrete paragraph
                   and milestone id, which is done via the labels
                   associated with every comment in the issue
                   repository.  However, the book contents obviously
                   change every milestone, and so we found it
                   convenient to have
                   a <a href="http://github.com/bactrian">bot</a> that
                   uses
                   the <a href="http://github.com/avsm/ocaml-github">OCaml
                   Github bindings</a> to add a contextual link
                   containing the paragraph text to every comment.
                   This lets us (the authors) browse all of the book
                   issues directly using the excellent Github UI, and
                   jump straight to the relevant section in the HTML
                   version of the book if we need to.</p>
                <p>Bactrian is a double-humped camel to distinguish us
                from our single-humped Perl friends.  Remember, a
                dromedary camel has one hump and a bactrian has two
                (writing the D and the B will help you tell them
                apart).  We're still giddy that we blagged a camel for
                our book...</p>
                  
                 <p><b>What license is the book released under?</b></p>
                 <p>The online HTML version of the book is available
                 under
                 a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/us/">Creative
                 Commons Attribution- Noncommercial-No Derivative
                 Works 3.0 United States License</a>, which means that
                 you are welcome to copy, distribute and transmit the
                 work, but must give us attribution, not create
                 derived works from it, or use it directly for
                 commercial purposes (it's fine to use to within your
                 workplace to learn OCaml, of course, but not to
                 re-sell the book directly.</p>
                 <p>We'd like to thank O'Reilly for their generosity
                 in allowing this online version to be available
                 freely.  Of course, we encourage you to also purchase
                 a copy of the book from them.  The O'Reilly
                 production team is doing a tremendous job of
                 typesetting and editing the print version of the book
                 into a beautiful edition that's worthy of a place on
                 your shelf.</p>

                 <p><b>Is the source code to the website commenting system available?</b></p>
                 <p>It's not right now, but only because the authors
                 are so busy finishing the book.  Anil is planning to
                 tidy up the toolchain and open-source it just as soon
                 as he finds time.  All the libraries used to build
                 it, such
                 as <a href="http://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cohttp">ocaml-cohttp</a>
                 or <a href="http://github.com/avsm/ocaml-github">ocaml-github</a>
                 are already all available
                 via <a href="http://opam.ocamlpro.com">OPAM</a>.</p>
